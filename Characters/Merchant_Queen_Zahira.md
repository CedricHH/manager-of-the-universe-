## The Southern Empire

While Victor conquered the north through dungeon and kingdom, Zahira controlled the south through **trade**.

Her family built merchant empires for 400 years. Spice routes. Silk caravans. Banking networks.

She is Victor's first TRUE economic equal.

---

## The Rivalry

Zahira doesn't fear Victor. She COMPETES with him.

> "You think you invented exploitation? My grandmother was leveraging debt before your world had writing."

Unlike other opponents, Zahira doesn't attack. She **out-trades**.

---

## The Recognition

Both realize: Destroying each other is expensive. Merger is profitable.

The "North-South Compact" (Ch 680) creates the largest trade network in history.

Zahira joins Victor's board. As an EQUAL.

> "I don't work FOR you."
> "I know. That's why this works."

---

## Psychology

### Ruthless Professional

No sentimentality. No nationalism. Only profit.

She respects Victor because he's the same.

### The Difference

She has heirs. Legacy matters. Victor has... nothing.

This becomes relevant later.

## Speech Pattern

Cultured, sharp, amused:

> "You northern barbarians are finally learning to count. How charming."

> "Hostile takeover? Please. We call that 'Tuesday.'"

> "My cartel has survived seventeen empires. You'll need to try harder to impress me."
