## Origin Story

### The Forgotten Princess

Seraphina is the third daughter of King Aldric IV. In a kingdom that values sons, she was invisible. Her sisters were married off. Her brothers inherited titles. Seraphina studied in dusty libraries and learned to be quiet.

She expected to be married to some minor lord. She expected a boring life of irrelevance.

She did not expect to become **debt collateral**.

### The Transfer

When the Kingdom of Valdris collapsed under Victor's economic warfare, the King offered increasingly desperate payments:
- First: Gold (depleted)
- Then: Land (mortgaged)
- Then: Army (contracted to Victor)
- Finally: His daughter

The contract was simple: Seraphina would "serve" Victor until the debt was repaid. The King assumed this meant... the worst.

So did Seraphina.

## The Twist

Victor looked at her like a spreadsheet.

> "You're educated. Literate. Know court etiquette. Potential mage affinity... 
> The kingdom valued you at 50,000 gold as 'compensation.'
> They undervalued you by approximately 400%."

He didn't touch her. He didn't leer. He handed her a *performance review form*.

> "Fill this out. Preferences, skills, career goals. 
> You're an asset now, and I optimize my assets."

## Psychology

### Initial State: Terror

Seraphina expected:
- Slavery
- Abuse
- Death

She prepared herself mentally for the worst.

### Current State: Confused Relief

What she received:
- Private quarters (nicer than the castle)
- Education budget
- Magic training (she has latent talent)
- A job title: "Royal Affairs Consultant"

She's waiting for the other shoe to drop. It doesn't.

### The Realization

Victor treats her **exactly like his other employees**:
- Expectations are clear
- Performance is rewarded
- Failure has consequences (demotion, not death)
- She has actual value

No one in the palace ever treated her as anything but decoration. Victor treats her as an investment. Somehow, this feels like... respect?

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Victor** | "Owner." Terrifying. Fair. The first person to see her as capable. |
| **Elara** | Sympathizes; sees parallels (both trapped women) |
| **Sniv** | Confusing. He calls her "Princess Asset." Strangely comforting. |
| **Her Family** | Abandoned her. She owes them nothing. |

## Speech Pattern

Formal, cautious, increasingly confident:

> "I... I'll do whatever you require, my lord."
> "It's 'employer,' not 'lord.' And what I require is this quarterly report by Thursday."

> "You're not going to... I mean, the contract says 'service,' but..."
> "The contract specifies administrative duties. Section 3, clause 7. Did you not read it?"

> (Later) "The northern lords are embezzling. I've prepared a dossier."
> "Excellent. You're getting a raise."

## Thematic Purpose

Seraphina represents what power COULD look like:
- Victor exploits, but he also *builds*
- Those he "owns" often end up better off than those who were "free"
- Is this good? Is this just efficient evil? 

She doesn't know. Neither does the reader.
