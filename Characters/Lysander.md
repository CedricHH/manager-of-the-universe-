## Origin

Lysander is everything Victor was *supposed* to fight:
- Genuinely heroic
- Blessed by the gods
- Loved by the people
- Believes in justice

He's the protagonist of a different story—one where heroes win through courage and villains fall to righteous swords.

Then he met Victor.

## The Confrontation (Ch 451-510)

Lysander rallies the people against "The Manager." He expects:
- Epic battle
- Moral clarity
- Triumphant victory

What he gets:
- Victor won't fight him (bad ROI)
- Victor's "victims" don't want to be saved
- The Kingdom was exploiting people MORE than Victor

### The Breaking Point

> Lysander: "You exploit the helpless!"
> Victor: "I employ them. With contracts. What did the Kingdom give them?"
> Lysander: "The Kingdom protects—"
> Victor: "Name one thing."
> Lysander: "..."

## The Recruitment

Victor doesn't defeat Lysander through debt or force.

He defeats him through **truth**.

The Kingdom was corrupt. The Church was a pyramid scheme. The nobles were parasites.

Victor is *better* than what came before. Not good—but *better*.

Lysander joins because he has nowhere else to go. His faith is shattered. Victor offers pragmatic purpose.

---

## Psychology

### Before Victor
- Absolute belief in good vs evil
- Never questioned institutions
- Identity = "The Hero"

### After Victor
- Faith broken
- Realizes heroism requires power, not just virtue
- Learns from Victor (hates that he learns)

---

## Role in Story

Lysander is Lyra's mirror:
- Lyra was broken before meeting Victor
- Lysander is broken BY meeting Victor
- Both search for meaning in Victor's amoral empire

He also serves as Victor's **conscience** (not that Victor listens).

## Speech Pattern

Earnest, increasingly bitter:

> "I will stop you, villain!" (Ch 451)

> "How can they follow you? You're a monster!" (Ch 480)

> "...You're right. They're better off. I hate that you're right." (Ch 510)

> "Maybe good intentions aren't enough. Maybe I need to learn... your way." (Ch 550)
