## Lord Sterling's Sister

When Lord Sterling was captured and indebted by Victor (Ch 8-10), his family tried to rescue him.

They failed. The rescue team was captured.

Only Lily escaped—by offering herself as **additional collateral**.

## The Bargain

> "Take me instead. My brother is useless. 
> I know the family's trade secrets. The vault codes. 
> I'm worth more."

Victor agreed. She was right.

## Character Development

### Smart Prisoner

Unlike Sterling (who rages uselessly), Lily adapts:
- Studies Victor's methods
- Finds ways to reduce family debt
- Eventually becomes *useful* rather than hostage

### Reluctant Respect

She hates Victor. But she learns from him.

By Arc 2, she manages the Sterling estates (under Victor's oversight) better than her brother ever did.

> "You stole my family's future."
> "I invested in it. The returns have been excellent."
> "...I know. I prepared the report."

## Role

Lily represents what happens to "normal" nobles under Victor:
- Those who adapt survive
- Those who resist (like her brother) fail
- Is this evolution or conquest?
