## The Problem

Kharzul sits on the largest gold hoard ever accumulated.

**47 billion gold pieces.** Doing nothing. Just... sitting there.

For Victor, this is the greatest crime imaginable: **Unproductive capital.**

---

## The Dragon's View

Kharzul doesn't understand "investment." 

Gold is beautiful. Gold is power. Gold STAYS IN THE HOARD.

> "Spend it? Why would I SPEND it? It's MINE."

---

## The Negotiation (Ch 650-680)

Victor cannot kill Kharzul (too powerful).
Kharzul cannot ignore Victor (controls all trade).

The solution: **Joint venture.**

Victor "manages" Kharzul's hoard. Kharzul receives:
- 3% annual returns (more gold!)
- Tribute from terrorized nations (organized by Victor)
- Tax-exempt status

Kharzul gets more gold. Victor gets 47 billion in capital.

> "You're telling me... my gold will make MORE gold? Without leaving the hoard?"
> "Compound interest."
> "...This is the greatest magic I have ever witnessed."

## Role

Kharzul represents OLD wealth—static, hoarded, unproductive.

Victor transforms it into ACTIVE capital. The dragon learns economics.
