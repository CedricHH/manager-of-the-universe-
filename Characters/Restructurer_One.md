## The First Manager

Before Victor was #8940, before the Consortium had thousands of agents...

There was ONE.

Restructurer #1 was the prototype. The proof of concept. The first mortal given cosmic authority.

He succeeded beyond all projections. Made seventeen universes profitable.

Then he disappeared.

---

## The Truth

#1 didn't disappear. He was **archived**.

The Consortium realized: A truly successful Restructurer would eventually turn their methods on the CONSORTIUM ITSELF.

So they locked him away. Buried in cosmic bureaucracy. Filed under "Completed Projects."

For billions of years.

Until Victor's activities flagged his file.

## The Meeting

#1 contacts Victor through system backdoors.

> "You're doing well. Too well. They'll archive you too."
> "How do you know?"
> "Because they archived ME. And I was better than you."

---

## Role

#1 provides:
- Knowledge of Consortium weaknesses
- Proof that success leads to elimination
- A template for Victor's eventual confrontation

**The question**: Is #1 helping Victor? Or using him?

---

## Speech Pattern

Ancient, weary, knowing:

> "You think you're special? I thought that too. We're all special until we become threats."

> "The Consortium doesn't fear failure. They fear SUCCESS. Successful agents want MORE."

> "I'll help you. Not because I like you—because watching you burn them would be... entertaining."
