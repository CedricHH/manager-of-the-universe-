## Backstory

Xal'veth served the Demon King for three millennia. Loyal. Efficient. Unquestioning.

Then Malachar passed her over for promotion—giving the position to his nephew.

**Nepotism.** In HELL.

She defected to Victor within the week.

## Why She Matters

Xal'veth provides:
- Inside knowledge of demon military
- Legitimacy with demon defectors
- A terrifying combat asset
- Proof that Victor's "company" accepts ANYONE who performs

## Psychology

### Meritocracy Obsession

She didn't defect for morality. She defected because Victor promotes based on **results**.

> "Your Human Resources department... evaluates performance?"
> "Quarterly reviews."
> "...I have waited 3,000 years for this."

### Not Good

She's still a demon. Still enjoys violence. Still thinks mortals are amusing insects.

But she follows Victor's rules because they're **fair rules**.

## Speech Pattern

Military, formal, occasionally unsettling:

> "Your enemies? I will render them into components. Efficiently."

> "Malachar's weakness is his court. I know every name. Every grudge. Every debt."

> "You promoted the goblin to executive? Based on... performance? This is the most civilized organization I have ever served."
