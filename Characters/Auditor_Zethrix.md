## What is an Auditor?

The Galactic Audit Consortium manages reality itself:
- Worlds are "projects"
- Species are "assets"
- Gods are "middle management"
- Profit = Existence continues

Zethrix is the senior partner. He's been auditing universes since before stars formed.

## The Problem with Victor

Victor was sent to "restructure" one failing world.

He restructured the ENTIRE WORLD. Then started making demands.

> "Restructurer #8940 has exceeded operational parameters.
> Efficiency rating: 847% above projection.
> Risk assessment: Unpredictable.
> Recommendation: Termination and asset recovery."

## Psychology

### Cosmic Bureaucrat

Zethrix doesn't understand ambition. He follows protocols.

Victor's refusal to stay in his designated role is not "evil" or "threatening"—it's **disorderly**. And Zethrix hates disorder.

### The Irony

Victor is doing exactly what the Consortium SHOULD want—optimizing reality.

But optimization threatens the Auditors' jobs. If everything ran efficiently, who needs Auditors?

## Speech Pattern

Bureaucratic, ancient, emotionless:

> "Your performance metrics are impressive. Your termination is nonetheless required."

> "You misunderstand. We do not hate you. Hatred is inefficient. We simply... process."

> "The universe has operated for 14 billion years. Your suggestions for 'improvement' are noted and filed in subsection 7749-C. They will be reviewed in approximately 800 million years."
