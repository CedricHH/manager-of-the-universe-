## Role

Malcom represents Institutional Capital. He is not evil, but he is amoral. He views Chaos (Victor, Monsters, Free Markets) as a threat to Stability. He colludes with the Church not out of faith, but because the Church maintains order.

### Traits
- **Calculated**: Speaks in financial terms ("ROI", "Liquidity", "Assets").
- **Ancient Perspective**: As an elf, he plans in centuries. Victor's "rapid growth" looks like a cancer to him.
- **Double Agent**: Funds Victor to control him; reports to Aurelia to monitor him.
