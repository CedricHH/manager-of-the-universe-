## Role in Story

Lord Sterling is Victor's first "real" opponent—not a monster, but a human with status, power, and arrogance.

He exists to show:
1. Victor can beat physical threats through strategy
2. The nobility of this world is weak to economic warfare
3. Even "heroes" can be pathetic

## Psychology

### Core Traits

- **Arrogance**: Third son of a major house, never earned anything
- **Entitlement**: Believes the world owes him glory
- **Cowardice**: Brave only against weaker opponents
- **Debt-Ridden**: Family estate is mortgaged; needs dungeon loot

### The Irony

Sterling came to the Tutorial Dungeon for an "easy" boss kill to impress a lady. He expected glory. He found Victor.

## The Encounter (Chapter 7-9)

Sterling enters the dungeon expecting:
- Weak goblins (Victor's employees now)
- A slow minotaur (Asterion, now with strategy guide)
- Treasure (Victor's operational capital)

He finds none of this.

Instead, Victor lures him into a trap, dangles him over a pit, and forces him to sign a debt contract in exchange for his life.

**Sterling's Debt to Victor**: 90% of future earnings + first refusal on family estate

## Speech Pattern

Pompous, theatrical, increasingly desperate:

> "Do you know who I AM?!"

> "My father will—" / "Your father's credit rating is 'junk.' I checked."

> "This is... this is EXTORTION!" / "It's negotiation. Sign here."

---

## Future Role

Sterling becomes a recurring nuisance—always trying to escape his debt, always failing, occasionally useful as a patsy or scapegoat.
