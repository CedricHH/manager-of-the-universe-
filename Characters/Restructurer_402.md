## The Other Agent

The Galactic Audit Consortium sent TWO restructurers to Terra-Insolvia:
- Victor (#8940): Economic specialist
- #402: Necromancy specialist

Their philosophies clash completely.

## Philosophy: Death as Resource

> "The living are inefficient. They require food, rest, motivation.
> The dead require NOTHING. Infinite labor at zero cost.
> Necromancy is the ultimate economic system."

#402 doesn't see corpses as people. He sees them as **renewable resources**.

---

## The Conflict

Victor's model: Exploit the living through contracts.
#402's model: Replace the living with undead.

If #402 wins, there's no economy left—just a world of corpses.

Victor must destroy him not for moral reasons, but because **dead people don't buy products**.

---

## The Battle

Victor can't fight undead hordes directly.

Instead, he disrupts #402's supply chain:
- Funds cremation across kingdoms
- Introduces "Eternal Rest Insurance"
- Makes corpses legally protected property
- Eventually, #402's army runs out of bodies

---

## Fate

#402 is destroyed in Chapter 445.

His last words: "You... delayed the inevitable. Entropy always wins."

Victor's response: "Entropy doesn't file quarterly reports."
