## The Union Problem

When Victor dominates Oakhaven's economy, workers start organizing.

Benny leads them. He's loud, passionate, and absolutely convinced Victor is the enemy.

---

## The Confrontation

Benny storms into Victor's office, ready for battle:

> "Your exploitation ends TODAY! The workers DEMAND—"

Victor: "Double wages. Healthcare plan. Profit-sharing at 3%. Sign here."

> "...What?"

Victor (sighing): "Healthy workers produce more. Loyalty reduces turnover. It's basic human resources."

---

## The Twist

Victor isn't afraid of unions. He just absorbs them.

Benny becomes the "Workers' Liaison"—still advocating for workers, but within Victor's system.

He's not sure if he won or lost.

---

## Role

Benny represents common people. He provides:
- Working-class perspective
- Comic relief (his rage vs Victor's calm)
- Moral grounding (someone who cares about the "little people")

---

## Speech Pattern

Loud, passionate, confused:

> "You can't BUY the revolution!"
> "I'm not buying it. I'm franchising it."
> "...That's not... what does that MEAN?!"
