## Backstory

Thessa was the greatest engineer in the Dwarven Holds—until she proposed innovations.

The Elder Council called her designs "heretical." The old ways were sacred. Progress was sin.

They exiled her.

She wandered for decades until Victor offered something no dwarf ever had:

**Unlimited budget. Zero oversight. Full creative control.**

## Why She Works for Victor

> "Every empire I've served wanted 'practical' improvements.
> You asked me to build something *impossible*.
> Then you handed me the gold to try."

Victor doesn't understand engineering. He understands **investment**.

Thessa gets resources. Victor gets innovation.

## Psychology

### Obsessive Creator

Thessa doesn't care about money, power, or politics. She cares about **building things**.

She'd work for a demon if the demon provided copper wire.

### Morally Neutral

She doesn't ask what her inventions are used for. This bothers Elara. Thessa doesn't understand why.

## Speech Pattern

Technical, impatient, excited about projects:

> "Your problem isn't the gold flow. It's the inefficiency of mana conversion. I can fix that. Give me six weeks and 40,000 gold."

> "Ethics? Is that a type of metal? Can I forge with it?"

> "YES! IT WORKS! ...What do you mean 'casualties'? How many? Oh. Hmm. Version two will be safer. Probably."
