## Backstory

### The Corporate Chainsaw
Victor was a feared interim manager ("The Chainsaw") known for ruthless efficiency. He felt no sadism, but no empathy—people were numbers.

### The Betrayal & Project Cobalt
He was scapegoated for a conflict mineral scandal ("Project Cobalt") that killed 47 people, including children. He didn't know about the deaths until it was too late, but he signed the orders.
* **The One Selfless Act**: Instead of disappearing, he compiled evidence proving the board's complicity and delivered it to the victims' lawyers, getting himself assassinated in the process.

### System Selection
The Galactic Audit Consortium chose him not just for his ruthlessness, but for that single anomaly: he once prioritized "worth it" over profit.

### Chapter 51: The Crown Asset [ACT 1.3 START]

- **Project Cobalt Memory**: Recalled sitting in empty corner office, six months after scandal. Forty-seven faces. Children at Congolese mine.
- **The Math**: Calculated 200 future deaths if he stayed silent vs. ~15% survival if he released evidence.
- **The Decision**: Made first decision with negative personal ROI — walked to server room to download final evidence.
- **Server Room**: Six months of secret file copying. Final download interrupted by footsteps.
- **Sniv Revelation**: Goblin admitted to listening when Victor talks in sleep; knows about "server room."

### Chapter 53: The Selfless Act (Part 2) [FLASHBACK CONTINUED]
- **Download Complete**: Progress bar reached 100% as security guard passed by server room door.
- **Near Miss**: Flashlight swept under door; Victor hidden behind server rack.
- **Escape Route**: Pre-planned ventilation shaft exit; memorized route to loading dock.
- **The Drive**: 43-minute night drive to lawyers' office. Folder of 47 faces on passenger seat.
- **Internal State**: Expected fear or righteousness; felt nothing. "Just math."
- **15% Survival**: Calculated survival probability; accepted the outcome as optimal reallocation.
- **Present Day**: Team briefing for Crown Prince. Victor wonders if he'd die for his employees again.
- **ARMI Warning**: Memory integration 68% complete; avoiding final segments (Delivery, Death).

- **Parking Garage**: 2:47 AM. Victor considers turning around one final time; gets out anyway.
- **The Handoff**: Met Sarah Chen (employment lawyer) in her conference room. Delivered thumb drive and folder.

- **Key Line**: "I'm already destroyed. I just haven't stopped moving yet."
- **Survival Window**: Calculated 29 hours before board's security consultants would respond.
- **Outcome Revealed**: Board went to prison; case became ethics textbook material; families received settlements.
- **Death Confirmed**: Victor died 3 days after delivery. "Heart attack." It wasn't natural.
- **ARMI Update**: Memory integration 84% complete. Final segment (The Death) remaining.

### Chapter 55: The Selfless Act (Part 4) [FLASHBACK ARC FINALE]
- **The Termination**: Three days post-leak. Professional assassin entered apartment. Victor accepted death (ROI Positive).

- **Full Integration**: Memory complete (100%). Psychological Efficiency +15%.
- **Perspective**: Realized he wasn't saved; he was *recruited*.
## Recent Developments (Chapter 56-65)

- **Chapter 56 (Class Action)**: Blocked Guild's injunction to close dungeon by organizing adventurers into a "Class Action" lawsuit.
- **Chapter 57 (Safety Audit)**: Hosted "Crimson Blades" audit team; filmed their vandalism to blackmail Vorne.
- **Chapter 59 (The Settlement)**: Forced Vorne to sign a Settlement Agreement (6-month safety certificate) using the incriminating footage.
- **Chapter 60 (The VIP Experience)**: Gave Prince Aldric the "Corporate Tour." Secure a Royal Charter by offering 15% revenue kickbacks. Neutralized Aurelia's Sun-Construct using "Disco Protocol" (Prismatic Slime).
- **Chapter 61 (The Divine Audit)**: Interceded when Aurelia tried to destroy the Core. Manipulated Prince Aldric into protecting the dungeon by framing the Core as a "Royal Asset" (saving his 15% revenue).
- **Chapter 62 (The Compliance Officer)**: Successfully spun the presence of a menacing Paladin (Roland) as a "Royal Security Feature" to bring customers back. Approached by the **Gilded Ledger** (Bank) for potential investment.
- **Chapter 63 (The Gilded Ledger)**: Secured a 10,000 GP loan from Director Malcom by inventing "Loot Futures" (selling shares of future drops). Avoided giving up equity.
- **Chapter 64 (The Capital Injection)**: Used the loan to unlock Floor 4 ("Jungle of Avarice") and hired Gorg (The Ape King) as the Floor Boss. Discovered that the Bank's loan magic included literal "Financial Parasites" (Gold Mosquitoes) that are eating the dungeon's mana.
- **Chapter 65 (The Extermination)**: Weaponized Crown Compliance (Roland) against the Bank by filing a complaint for "unlicensed magical constructs." Forced Malcom to negotiate: reduced mosquitoes by 80%, disabled extraction capability, waived 500 GP interest. Discovered dead mosquitoes contain 5 GP mana cores. Started mosquito breeding farm to turn Bank's surveillance into renewable resource. **Status**: Bank war escalated - Malcom declared it "personal."

## Psychology & Traits

- **Utilitarian**: Calculates ROI on everything, including lives.
- **Buried Humanity**: Driven by the guilt of Project Cobalt (Ch 40 flashback), he refuses "wasteful" deaths but claims it's just efficiency.
- **Methods**: Contracts, leverage, economic pressure, information asymmetry. Never fights fair.
