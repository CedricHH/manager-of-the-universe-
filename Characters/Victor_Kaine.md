## Backstory

### The Corporate Chainsaw
Victor was a feared interim manager ("The Chainsaw") known for ruthless efficiency. He felt no sadism, but no empathy—people were numbers.

### The Betrayal & Project Cobalt
He was scapegoated for a conflict mineral scandal ("Project Cobalt") that killed 47 people, including children. He didn't know about the deaths until it was too late, but he signed the orders.
* **The One Selfless Act**: Instead of disappearing, he compiled evidence proving the board's complicity and delivered it to the victims' lawyers, getting himself assassinated in the process.

### System Selection
The Galactic Audit Consortium chose him not just for his ruthlessness, but for that single anomaly: he once prioritized "worth it" over profit.

## Psychology & Traits

- **Utilitarian**: Calculates ROI on everything, including lives.

- **Methods**: Contracts, leverage, economic pressure, information asymmetry. Never fights fair.
