## Backstory

### The Corporate Chainsaw
Victor was a feared interim manager ("The Chainsaw") known for ruthless efficiency. He felt no sadism, but no empathy—people were numbers.

### The Betrayal & Project Cobalt
He was scapegoated for a conflict mineral scandal ("Project Cobalt") that killed 47 people, including children. He didn't know about the deaths until it was too late, but he signed the orders.
* **The One Selfless Act**: Instead of disappearing, he compiled evidence proving the board's complicity and delivered it to the victims' lawyers, getting himself assassinated in the process.

### System Selection
The Galactic Audit Consortium chose him not just for his ruthlessness, but for that single anomaly: he once prioritized "worth it" over profit.

- **Chapter 61 (The Divine Audit)**: Interceded when Aurelia tried to destroy the Core. Manipulated Prince Aldric into protecting the dungeon by framing the Core as a "Royal Asset" (saving his 15% revenue).
- **Chapter 62 (The Compliance Officer)**: Successfully spun the presence of a menacing Paladin (Roland) as a "Royal Security Feature" to bring customers back. Approached by the **Gilded Ledger** (Bank) for potential investment.
- **Chapter 63 (The Gilded Ledger)**: Secured a 10,000 GP loan from Director Malcom by inventing "Loot Futures" (selling shares of future drops). Avoided giving up equity.
- **Chapter 64 (The Capital Injection)**: Used the loan to unlock Floor 4 ("Jungle of Avarice") and hired Gorg (The Ape King) as the Floor Boss. Discovered that the Bank's loan magic included literal "Financial Parasites" (Gold Mosquitoes) that are eating the dungeon's mana.
- **Chapter 65 (The Extermination)**: Weaponized Crown Compliance (Roland) against the Bank by filing a complaint for "unlicensed magical constructs." Forced Malcom to negotiate: reduced mosquitoes by 80%, disabled extraction capability, waived 500 GP interest. Discovered dead mosquitoes contain 5 GP mana cores. Started mosquito breeding farm to turn Bank's surveillance into renewable resource. **Status**: Bank war escalated - Malcom declared it "personal."
- **Chapter 66 (The Auditor)**: Bank sent hostile auditor (Thaddeus Crow) via Clause 89-F. Victor prepared perfect compliance documentation (500-page binder, medieval property law research). Weaponized compliance: zero violations found. Counterattacked by pitching "Loot Futures 2.0" (15,000 GP expansion loan) during the audit. Created bidding war threat (Bank of Sterling competitor). **Status**: Audit survived, second loan pending.
- **Chapter 67 (The Counteroffer)**: Received competing offers from Gilded Ledger (4.5% APR, control clauses) and Bank of Sterling (4.0% APR, no restrictions). Analyzed concentration risk (Sterling family exposure). Negotiated with Malcom, reducing demands. Introduced third competitor (Merchant's Guild Bank) to create market competition. Received best offer: 3.8% APR, no strings. **Status**: Three-way bidding war active, meeting with Merchant's Guild scheduled.
- **Chapter 68 (The Partnership)**: Met with Merchant's Guild (Guildmaster Voros Thane). Negotiated comprehensive partnership: 15,000 GP loan at 3.8% APR + exclusive transport rights with tiered fees (6-8%) + armed escorts + performance guarantees. Rejected Malcom and Sterling offers. Secured best financing deal in Oakhaven. **Status**: 15,000 GP capital acquired, Floor 5 development begins, Malcom enraged.
- **Chapter 69 (The Volcano)**: Purchased Floor 5 (Volcanic Biome) for 8,000 GP. Analyzed monster options via ARMI. Hired dragon boss: Ignatia "Iggy" the Ember Tyrant (5,000 GP + 100 GP/month + 20% loot). Capital reserves critical at 2,000 GP. Scenario planning shows 10-week bankruptcy window if Floor 5 fails. **Status**: Floor 5 operational, 3-day stress test scheduled, Malcom monitoring for bankruptcy.
- **Chapter 70 (The Stress Test)**: Crimson Blades stress-tested Floor 5. Dragon fight successful (3-phase combat, party impressed). Feedback: 9-10/10 scores. Economics: 124 GP/run insufficient. Innovated "Ember Trials" tournament concept: weekly competitive runs, leaderboards, 500 GP prize, spectator tickets, sponsorships. Revenue model: 1,500 GP/week vs 620 GP/week. **Status**: Tournament launching, Floor 5 validated.
- **Chapter 71 (The Launch)**: Launched first Ember Trials tournament. Day 1 results: 12 parties registered (600 GP entry fees), 23 spectators (1,150 GP). Crimson Blades won inaugural tournament (24:17 time). Total revenue: 1,750 GP, net profit: 1,200 GP. Monthly projection: 4,800 GP sustainable. Intelligence reports: Merchant's Guild, Alchemist's Guild, and Church of Eternal Light all sent observers. Received Church audit invitation (3-day deadline, High Priestess Aurelia). Malcom escalating vendetta, considering "Church option." **Status**: Tournament successful, multi-faction threat escalating, Church audit imminent.
- **Chapter 72 (The Preparation)**: Prepared for Church audit (750 pages perfect compliance docs). Day 2 Ember Trials: 15 parties, 34 spectators, 2,450 GP revenue, 1,900 GP profit. Silver Lance (Chapter 15 callback) attempted Floor 5, failed at 28% boss HP but reached Phase 3. Aurelia arrived 2 days early invoking "emergency inspection." Victor led her through viewing room (42 spectators = public opinion shield). Flashback triggered: "Worth It" moment Part 1 - assassination in Chicago apartment, final thought "ROI positive" before death. Aurelia reviewing all records overnight. **Status**: Church audit active, weaponized transparency strategy deployed, flashback integration 92%.
- **Chapter 73 (The Examination)**: Church audit completed - zero violations found. Aurelia shifted to character assassination strategy (public sermon). Flashback completed: "Worth It" Part 2 - Consortium recruitment in the void, revealed as "reallocation" not rescue. Consortium chose Victor for rare combination: "ruthless optimization + calculated sacrifice." Memory integration: 100% complete. Counter-strategy: Community Fund established (10% Ember Trials revenue to orphanage = 480 GP/month). Public opinion secured (+40% approval). Week 2 tournament: 15 parties, 5,200 GP projected. Galactic Audit Consortium observing, considering promotion to Authority Level 2. **Status**: Church threat neutralized, flashback arc complete, Consortium monitoring performance.
- **Chapter 74 (The Phenomenon)**: Ember Trials exploded into cultural phenomenon - 23 parties registered, 87 spectators, broadcasts in 4 taverns, merchandise sales, children playing "Dragon Hunt". Week 2 revenue: 6,800 GP projected. Three guild threats: (1) Groll/Alchemist (potion monopoly extortion - rejected), (2) Kael/Mercenary (elite difficulty leverage - countered with Tier system revelation), (3) Voros/Merchant (franchise expansion offer - accepted pilot program, 8,000 GP investment). Coordinated guild cartel formed - all 23 parties withdrew via threatening letters, 92 spectators expecting tournament. Crisis response: "Escalate" - employee exhibition matches planned. **Status**: Cultural phenomenon achieved, guild cartel active, emergency countermeasures deploying.
- **Chapter 75 (The Exhibition)**: **ARC FINALE (Ch 72-75)**. Employee exhibition executed: Team Management (Asterion/Valerius/Zip) won 31:14, Team Operations (Gorg/Sniv/Roland) won 28:06, Victor solo won 19:02 (new record) via [Termination Protocol] exploit (fired Ignatia mid-combat, rehired immediately). Demonstrated skills: [Efficiency Optimization], [Resource Reallocation], [Hostile Acquisition], [Termination Protocol]. 3/3 victories, 100% spectator satisfaction, 95% brand loyalty achieved. Guild cartel broken. Franchise expansion approved (Rivercrest pilot, 3 weeks). Roland considering competitive participation. **Status**: Arc complete - Church neutralized, tournament cultural phenomenon, guild threats eliminated, expansion phase beginning.
- **Chapter 76 (The Franchise Model)**: **ACT 1.4 START - EXPANSION PHASE**. Received three franchise bids for Rivercrest; anonymous bidder revealed as Lady Elara Ravenshield (excommunicated Paladin, full story: reported Aurelia's embezzlement, framed for heresy, lost everything). Conducted "moral audit" - weaponized transparency strategy. Elara negotiated ethical clauses (voluntary termination, above-market wages, third-party audits) reducing profit 18% but regulatory risk 65%. Victor accepted: uses her morality as management tool. Franchise partnership signed: 8,000 GP (Elara's entire net worth), 60/40 equity split, 18-day launch timeline. ARMI detected Church surveillance at Rivercrest site - Aurelia escalating personal vendetta (former subordinate now partnering with audit target). Intelligence gathering initiated on Church assets. **Status**: Franchise expansion beginning, Church conflict escalating to warfare phase.
- **Chapter 77 (The Hostile Takeover)**: **DUNGEON WAR ARC START**. Guild Coalition (Groll/Kael) and Church Arbitrator attempted regulatory seizure of Rivercrest site. Victor executed "Insurance Arbitrage" protocol. Site intentionally liquidated through "planned asset destruction" to trigger Merchant Guild reinsurance. Victor weaponized damages (scorched Southern Marble, Tier 4 alchemical residues) for legal arbitration. Site destroyed but data secured. 85,000 GP insurance claim filed (~2,100% ROI on initial construction). Strategic shift initiated: attacking Guild treasuries in undefended home territories. **Status**: Capital war initiated, transition from defense to hostile acquisition.
- **Chapter 78 (Hostile Acquisition)**: Executed "Corporate Raider" strategy. Used 85,000 GP payout to purchase the debt of the Oakhaven Potion Synthesis Labs and the Adventurer Hub. Foreclosed on Alchemist Guild assets, triggering a liquidity freeze for Groll. Purchased land deeds beneath the Cathedral of Light, effectively becoming the Church's landlord. Demonstrated "Supply Chain Strangling" technique. **Status**: Economic dominance in Oakhaven achieved; controlling hero employment via Hub mortgage.

- **Chapter 79 (The Severance Package)**: Executed "Involuntary Merger" of the Alchemist and Mercenary Guilds. Forced Groll and Kael into middle-management roles as heads of operational subsidiaries. Weaponized the "Urban Development Trust" of 812 to charge the Cathedral of Light 5,000 GP/month in rent. Triggered total quest-freeze at the Hub to force compliance. **Status**: Regional dominance achieved; transition to Act 2 (The City) in progress.

- **Chapter 82 (The Resource Allocation)**: Established base of operations in Aethelgard. Recruited analysts Mina and Silas. Discovered the "Too Big To Fail" suicide pact involving the Onyx Syndicate.
- **Chapter 83 (The Pre-Deployment Strike)**: Executed a strategic leak regarding Valoria's yields, triggering a market crash for Onyx Syndicate bonds. Leveraged 300,000 GP of the Imperial budget to "short-sell" the Syndicate. Received a high-stakes invitation from Senior Partner Hestia to a "Welcome Social" involving the target (Governor Malphas). **Status**: Preparing for a social ambush; weaponizing the audit.

## Psychology & Traits

- **Utilitarian**: Calculates ROI on everything, including lives.
- **Buried Humanity**: Driven by the guilt of Project Cobalt (Ch 40 flashback), he refuses "wasteful" deaths but claims it's just efficiency.
- **Methods**: Contracts, leverage, economic pressure, information asymmetry. Never fights fair.
