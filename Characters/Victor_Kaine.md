## Backstory

### The Corporate Chainsaw
Victor was a feared interim manager ("The Chainsaw") known for ruthless efficiency. He felt no sadism, but no empathy—people were numbers.

### The Betrayal & Project Cobalt
He was scapegoated for a conflict mineral scandal ("Project Cobalt") that killed 47 people, including children. He didn't know about the deaths until it was too late, but he signed the orders.
* **The One Selfless Act**: Instead of disappearing, he compiled evidence proving the board's complicity and delivered it to the victims' lawyers, getting himself assassinated in the process.

### System Selection
The Galactic Audit Consortium chose him not just for his ruthlessness, but for that single anomaly: he once prioritized "worth it" over profit.

- **The Decision**: Made first decision with negative personal ROI — walked to server room to download final evidence.
- **Server Room**: Six months of secret file copying. Final download interrupted by footsteps.

- **Survival Window**: Calculated 29 hours before board's security consultants would respond.
- **Outcome Revealed**: Board went to prison; case became ethics textbook material; families received settlements.

## Psychology & Traits

- **Utilitarian**: Calculates ROI on everything, including lives.
- **Buried Humanity**: Driven by the guilt of Project Cobalt (Ch 40 flashback), he refuses "wasteful" deaths but claims it's just efficiency.
- **Methods**: Contracts, leverage, economic pressure, information asymmetry. Never fights fair.
