## Backstory

### The Corporate Chainsaw

Victor was a feared interim manager for Fortune 500 companies, specializing in radical restructuring. His nickname "The Chainsaw" came from his ruthless efficiency—he made companies profitable by eliminating entire departments and optimizing supply chains to their breaking point.

He felt no sadistic pleasure in layoffs. He felt no empathy either. People were rows in an Excel spreadsheet. Numbers to be optimized.

### The Betrayal

Despite his loyalty to profit, he became the scapegoat for an unethical raw materials scandal. The board sacrificed him for their own survival. Victor lost everything: reputation, career, the respect he had earned through decades of ruthless competence.

This cemented his worldview: **Loyalty is weakness. Only control guarantees security.**

### The Aftermath (Hidden Depth)

After the betrayal, Victor was a man without purpose. No company would hire "The Chainsaw" now—he was toxic. For six months, he existed in a luxury apartment, drinking expensive whiskey and calculating the exact monetary value of his wasted potential.

Then he discovered something.

The scandal that destroyed him? It was real. The raw materials—conflict minerals from a war zone. Children had died in those mines. His optimizations had increased production quotas, which had increased the body count.

He had never asked where the materials came from. It wasn't in the spreadsheet.

### The One Selfless Act

Victor could have walked away. The scandal was already buried, the board members had moved on to new companies. No one was looking.

But for reasons he never fully understood—and would later rationalize as "protecting future market reputation"—he compiled everything. Every email. Every invoice. Every meeting note that proved the board knew and approved.

He sent it to journalists, regulators, and the families of the victims' lawyers.

Then he went to the company headquarters. Not to confront anyone. To retrieve the physical server backups—the only copies that couldn't be deleted remotely.

He made it to the server room. He copied the data.

The security guard who found him was a 23-year-old kid working his way through college. Victor could have incapacitated him easily. Instead, he raised his hands. "Just let me walk out with this drive. Please."

The kid called for backup. In the chaos, Victor suffered a massive heart attack—stress, years of 80-hour weeks, too much caffeine and too little sleep finally catching up.

His last thought, as he collapsed holding the hard drive, was strange. Not annoyance at an "unproductive exit." Something quieter.

*Worth it.*

He died in a corporate hallway, clutching evidence that would eventually lead to three executives' imprisonment and $2.3 billion in reparations.

No one knew he was the source. The journalists protected him. His obituary mentioned only the scandal that destroyed his career, not the redemption that followed.

### Why the System Chose Him

The Galactic Audit Consortium's algorithm scanned billions of souls. It wasn't looking for heroes—heroes were inefficient. It wasn't looking for villains—villains were unstable.

It was looking for someone who understood systems, exploited systems, and—crucially—had once, just once, chosen something over profit.

Victor's soul lit up in cold blue. Maximum values in [Efficiency], [Logistics], and [Exploitation].

But there was something else. A tiny flicker of warmth in the data. An anomaly.

The algorithm flagged it as: **[POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT]**

Victor would never know this. He would arrive in Terra-Insolvia believing he was chosen purely for his ruthlessness. The truth—that his one selfless act was the tiebreaker—would remain hidden in cosmic bureaucracy.

## Psychology

### Core Traits

- **Utilitarianism**: If killing a village yields 10,000 Gold and saving it yields 500, he kills the village. Not from malice—from mathematics.
- **No Sadism**: Victor does not enjoy suffering. He simply doesn't factor it into his calculations.
- **Standards**: He doesn't lie directly (breach of contract, bad for reputation). He exploits fine print and information asymmetry.
- **Protection of Assets**: He protects his "employees" (party members) ruthlessly—but only because their training cost time and money.
- **Buried Humanity**: Deep beneath the cynicism lies the man who died holding a hard drive. He will never admit this exists.

### Inner Conflict

His humanity (which he sees as a weakness/inefficiency) versus his role as the System's avatar.

The question the story subtly asks: Will he ever choose "worth it" again?
