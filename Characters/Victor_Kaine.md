## Backstory

### The Corporate Chainsaw
Victor was a feared interim manager ("The Chainsaw") known for ruthless efficiency. He felt no sadism, but no empathy—people were numbers.

### The Betrayal & Project Cobalt
He was scapegoated for a conflict mineral scandal ("Project Cobalt") that killed 47 people, including children. He didn't know about the deaths until it was too late, but he signed the orders.
* **The One Selfless Act**: Instead of disappearing, he compiled evidence proving the board's complicity and delivered it to the victims' lawyers, getting himself assassinated in the process.

### System Selection
The Galactic Audit Consortium chose him not just for his ruthlessness, but for that single anomaly: he once prioritized "worth it" over profit.

Successfully identified "Clause 44-B" (the scorched-earth suicide pact) not as a threat, but as another form of asset liquidation.
- **Chapter 85 (The Decompression Protocol)**: Malphas triggered the explosion. Victor executed a "Hostile Takeover" of the exploding asset (100 GP), then used `[Asset Liquidation]` to convert the mana-volatility into currency. **Yield**: +45,000 GP. Malphas arrested.

Discovered Exchange limitations: Reputation Tier system (Weekly limit: 25,000 GP; requires 10 transactions to unlock Tier 2). Received warning from ADMINISTRATOR_HESTIA: "Every transaction leaves a mana trace." Listed [Miracle: Rain] for 45,000 GP (anonymous). Strategic pivot: Must build shell companies and diversify sales to avoid Church detection. **Ambushed**: Coordinated bandit attack (30+ hostiles) on Imperial Highway—intelligence suggests someone knows his 30-day deadline. **Status**: In combat.

Discovered Coalition political motivation: control rain = eliminate Church leverage = rebellion viability. **Intercepted**: Church Inquisitors (Paladin-Commander Theron, Level 20) halt caravan for "unauthorized divine commerce" audit. Exchange evidence in pocket (obsidian card). **Status**: Under Church detention; cannot fight (12% win probability); cannot run (fugitive status).

## Psychology & Traits

- **Utilitarian**: Calculates ROI on everything, including lives.
- **Buried Humanity**: Driven by the guilt of Project Cobalt (Ch 40 flashback), he refuses "wasteful" deaths but claims it's just efficiency.
- **Methods**: Contracts, leverage, economic pressure, information asymmetry. Never fights fair.

**Chapter 101 - The Expansion Plan (ARC 2 START - REWRITTEN)**: Received new Consortium tier: **REGIONAL OPERATOR** with 10,000,000 GP target (no deadline). Unlocked new skills: [Institutional Analysis], [Market Penetration Protocol]. Identified **Merchant Guild licensing monopoly** (Guild Master **Lysander Corvus**, 38-year veteran, 15% transaction fees = 520k GP/year rent-seeking). Discovered **Crown Territory loophole**: Dungeon Commerce Act exempts dungeon entrances from City Guild licensing. Invested 45,000 GP total (30k GP Insolvia Apothecary storefront + 15k GP slime farm expansion to 4,000 cores/week). Negotiated with Nova (2.5% storefront revenue + Floor 6 priority). **Strategy**: Bypass Guild licensing entirely via dungeon entrance shop, create political constituency (adventurers save 15% = voters against Guild regulations). Assigned tasks: Sniv (train 10 goblin shopkeepers), Asterion (hire 12 guards), Marcus (scale potion production). **ALERT**: Detected unknown Restructurer-class mana signature in Market Quarter (68% probability of second Consortium agent). Quest received: [Market Intelligence]. **Net Worth after investment**: 977,000 GP. **Status**: Preparing for dual conflict (Merchant Guild legal war + Restructurer identification).

Observed Sniv's Customer Service Academy training 10 goblins (graduation: 4 days). Conducted security audit with Asterion: 12 guards hired, apothecary 90% fortified, slime farm 87% complete (first harvest in 2 days). **CRITICAL**: Received encrypted message from **Restructurer #418 (Kira, Designation: Liaison)**—Consortium evaluator requesting meeting at Broken Barrel Inn (noon, next day).

Accepted meeting. **Status**: Preparing for dual evaluation (Kira + Groll).

**Chapter 103 - The Liaison**: Met **Restructurer #418 (Kira, Designation: Liaison)** at Broken Barrel Inn. **Consortium Structure Revealed**: Learned full tier system (Tier 1: 73% failure, Tier 2: 46%, Tier 3: 12%, Tier 4: classified). Kira = former record-holder (67 days to 1M GP; Victor beat her at 23 days). **Tier 4 Mission Offered**: **BROKEN CROWN** (Planet: Terra-Solvaris, 5-way civil war, 12M GP Consortium investment at risk, 6-month stabilization deadline). Previous attempts: 4 Restructurers dead, 3 psychologically broken (57% fatality rate). **Reward**: Skip Tier 2 entirely, instant Tier 3 promotion + full Consortium support + dimensional market access. **Team Composition**: Victor (Lead), Kira (Liaison), 2 unknown operatives. **Success Criteria**: Stabilize government, recover 12M GP investment, install Consortium-friendly regime. **Failure Penalty**: Team termination. **Decision Window**: 2 weeks. **Kira's Warning**: Lysander will discover unlicensed apothecary in 3 days (timeline acceleration required). **Victor's Decision**: Deferred BROKEN CROWN choice to finish Guild War first.
