## Backstory

Unknown. Vex tells a different story every time:
- Orphan raised by assassin guild
- Noble daughter gone wrong
- Demon in disguise
- "Just really bored"

The truth? Doesn't matter. What matters: She's terrifyingly good at killing.

## Why She Works for Victor

Victor pays in "exposure"—loot rights, reputation, interesting targets.

But the real reason:

> "Everyone else wants me to pretend I'm normal. 
> You just want results and don't care how.
> That's... refreshing."

Victor is the first employer who doesn't expect her to fake emotions.

## Psychology

### Genuine Psychopath

- No empathy (clinical, not theatrical)
- Finds social norms confusing but learnable
- Violence is neutral; a tool, not pleasure
- Genuinely curious about "normal" people

### Not Evil

Vex isn't sadistic. She just doesn't understand why killing matters.

She follows Victor's rules because they're **rules**, and rules are easy.

## Dynamics

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Victor** | Fascinating. He's like her but with math instead of knives. |
| **Elara** | Keeps trying to "save" Vex. Vex finds this adorable. |
| **Sniv** | Best friend? He's weird too. Compatible weird. |
| **Asterion** | Respects his efficiency. Compares kill counts. |
| **Seraphina** | Watches her like a cat watches a bird. Makes Seraphina nervous. |

## Combat

## Speech Pattern

Flat, curious, occasionally disturbing:

> "Can I kill that one? No? What about that one? ...That one?"

> "You're crying. Is that... sad? Or happy? The water makes it confusing."

> "I read a book about 'friendship.' We should try that. 
> Step one: Share secrets. My secret is I've killed 847 people. Your turn."

## Arc Development

- Ch 201: Recruited
- Ch 220-250: Team dynamics (chaos element)
- Ch 300+: Possible humanity arc? (Learning to feel? Or learning to fake better?)
