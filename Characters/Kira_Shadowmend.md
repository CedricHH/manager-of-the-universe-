## Backstory

Elves live for thousands of years. Most spend them on art, magic, philosophy.

Kira spent hers on **numbers**.

She was the financial administrator for the Elven Grand Archive—until she discovered the Council was embezzling. She reported it. They buried the evidence and exiled her.

Sound familiar?

## Why Victor

When Victor explained his system—ARMI, gold-mana conversion, compound interest as magic—Kira felt something she hadn't felt in a century:

**Professional interest.**

> "You've quantified MAGIC. You've turned divine favor into SPREADSHEETS.
> This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."

---

## Role

Kira manages the numbers Victor doesn't have time for:
- Tax optimization (aggressive)
- Currency manipulation
- Debt portfolio management
- Fraud detection

She's the one who makes Victor's empire *work*.

## Psychology

### True Neutral

Kira doesn't care if Victor is good or evil. She cares if the numbers balance.

Murder is just an expense. Charity is just an investment. Everything is ledger entries.

### Competitive

She sees Victor's rise as a **game**. Can they break historical records? Can they achieve wealth no mortal has touched?

## Dynamics

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Victor** | Intellectual equal in her field. Delightful. |
| **Thessa** | Mutual respect. R&D and Finance work well together. |
| **Lyra** | "You're bad at budgeting." (Lyra finds this insulting) |
| **Sniv** | Trained him in basic accounting. Proud of his progress. |

## Speech Pattern

Precise, dry, occasionally condescending:

> "Your proposal is 3.7% less efficient than the alternative. I've prepared a memo."

> "Moral considerations? Those go in column J, 'Intangible Liabilities.' The current liability is 12,000 gold in potential reputation damage. Proceed if margin exceeds that."

> "I've lived 247 years. This is the first organization that understands compound interest. I'm not leaving."
