## Origin Story

### 247 Years of Service

Asterion was created by the Dungeon Core to guard the boss chamber. For 247 years, he did exactly that.

He killed 1,847 adventurers. He died 12 times (respawning each time—dungeon mechanics). He never left the boss room. He never questioned his purpose.

He received:
- No pay
- No vacation days
- No performance reviews
- No explanation of why he existed

He was furniture. Deadly furniture, but furniture.

### The Realization

Victor's [Aggressive Negotiations] didn't defeat Asterion through pain. It defeated him through *analysis*.

Victor pointed out:
- 247 years of service, zero advancement
- No retirement plan
- No benefits
- Other dungeon bosses had larger treasure rooms
- His kill/death ratio was above average, yet no recognition

For the first time in his existence, Asterion experienced something worse than a hero's sword: **the knowledge that he was undervalued**.

### The Breakdown

Asterion's psyche crumbled not from violence, but from PowerPoint slides.

Victor presented a comparison chart. Asterion saw his worth quantified—and found lacking. The existential horror of being a replaceable asset destroyed him more thoroughly than any legendary weapon.

He surrendered not to Victor's strength, but to his *spreadsheet*.

## Psychology

### Core Traits

- **Existential Crisis (Ongoing)**: Why does he exist? What is purpose? Victor says "profit." Is that enough?
- **Desperate for Structure**: Without the Dungeon Core's commands, he's lost. Victor provides new orders. This is... acceptable.
- **Hidden Intellect**: 247 years of watching adventurers taught him tactics. He's smarter than he appears.
- **Quiet Dignity**: Despite his trauma, he maintains formal speech and professional demeanor.

### The Tragedy

Asterion is not evil. He never chose to kill adventurers—it was his function. Now free from the Core, he doesn't know how to feel about his 1,847 kills.

Victor doesn't care about his moral crisis. This is somehow comforting.

## Equipment

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **The Compliance Tool** | Massive double-headed greataxe. Named by Victor. Asterion secretly hates the name. |
| **Reading Glasses** | Comically small for his face. Used to review contracts. |
| **Security Badge** | Victor issued it. Asterion wears it with pride. |
| **Formal Vest** | Attempts to look professional. Mostly fails due to fur. |

## Skills

| Skill | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Labyrinth Mastery** | Perfect navigation in any dungeon-like structure |
| **Boss Presence** | Intimidation aura; weaker creatures flee |
| **Charge** | Devastating rush attack (+300% damage on first hit) |
| **Last Stand** | Below 10% HP: Damage doubled, cannot be stunned |
| **Contract Bound** | Victor's contract prevents betrayal (and provides dental) |

---

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Victor** | Employer. Confusing. Terrifying in ways that have nothing to do with combat. |
| **Sniv** | Colleague? The small one tries too hard. Asterion respects effort. |
| **Elara** | She reminds him of heroes he killed. This is uncomfortable. |
| **Dungeon Core** | Former master. Asterion feels... nothing? Is that wrong? |

## Speech Pattern

Formal, measured, slightly archaic:

> "I have reviewed the proposal. The terms are... acceptable."

> "In 247 years, no adventurer asked my name. You are the first to offer a contract instead of a sword. This is... novel."

> "The small green one calls this 'synergy.' I do not understand the word, but I understand we are stronger together."

> "You wish me to... not kill the intruders? This is inefficient. But the contract specifies non-lethal options. I will comply."

**Philosophical Note**:

Asterion represents what happens when a being exists only for function. Victor offers him something the Dungeon Core never did: a *reason* beyond killing.

Whether that reason (profit) is better is a question Asterion doesn't ask. Yet.
