## Psychology

- **The Velvet Hammer**: Unlike Vane’s cold grey, Hestia is warm, smiling, and "helpful"—until she finds an opening to liquidate your assets and absorb your territory.
- **territorial**: She sees Victor as an intruder in the Bureau’s ecosystem and is determined to "neutralize" him before he can disrupt the Senior Partner balance.
- **High Liquidation Rate**: She has the highest record in the Bureau for turning failing assets into immediate Imperial cash, often at the cost of the local population.

## Appearance

- **Attire**: Iridescent white silk suits. 
- **Scent**: Expensive jasmine and ozone.
- **Key Feature**: Startling metallic silver eyes that seem to "scan" people for vulnerabilities.

## Relations

- **Victor Kaine**: Sees him as an "acquisition" to be either absorbed or eliminated. Offered him a 10% finders fee to drop Project Valoria.
- **Thaddeus Vane**: Polite but cold rivalry. They disagree on "recruitment" methods.
