## History & Interactions

### Chapter 15: The Roar
- Arrived at the dungeon following rumors from Jace & Mira (Chapter 14).
- Systematically cleared Floor 1 & 2, bypassing traps and ignoring goblin "scare" tactics.
- Reached Floor 3 and identified Marcus's Sword as "Soulbound/Useless."
- Attempted to leave due to lack of loot.
- Fled in terror after Asterion woke up and roared.
- **Impact**: They now know the dungeon contains a "Real Boss" (Asterion), likely raising the dungeon's threat rating in town.

## Abilities & Tactic

- **Formation**: Standard Diamond (Tank front, Healer center, DPS flank).
- **Professionalism**: check corners, use *Identify*, do not engage with low-value threats (goblins).
- **Weakness**: Unprepared for Boss-level threats (Level 25+).
