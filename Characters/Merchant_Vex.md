---

## Basic Information

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Merchant Vex |
| **Company** | Blackwood Trading Company |
| **Territory** | Southern Provinces (Terra-Insolvia) |
| **Specialty** | Cross-border smuggling, luxury goods |
| **First Mentioned** | Chapter 90 |

---

## Business Profile

### Blackwood Trading Company
- **Front**: Legitimate luxury goods trader
- **Reality**: Smuggling operation with Church of Eternal Light ties
- **Routes**: Southern trade corridors between provinces
- **Reputation**: Mixed (competent but morally flexible)

### Church Connection
- **Role**: Financial proxy for Church of Eternal Light
- **Function**: Handles "sensitive acquisitions" the Church can't pursue publicly
- **Vulnerability**: If exposed, loses smuggler network (rivals will blacklist Church proxies)

## Chapter 90: The Failed Ambush

### The Contract
- **Objective**: Capture Victor Kaine alive
- **Hired**: Kade's Company (42 sellswords)
- **Payment**: 25,000 GP bounty
- **Contract Type**: Magically binding with suicide clause (to prevent betrayal)
- **Management Style**: Paranoid (didn't trust Kade to stay loyal)

### The Failure
- Victor identified the contract's transfer clause
- Used [Contract Override Token] to steal Kade's contract
- Vex lost his mercenary force and revealed his Church connection

### Strategic Error
Victor's analysis: **"Sloppy management."**

Vex's mistakes:
1. Used suicide clause (created resentment in contractor)
2. Didn't read fine print (transfer clause exploited)
3. Hired mid-tier mercenaries for high-value target (underestimated Victor)
4. Acted pre-emptively (Church panic move after detecting Galactic Exchange activity)

---

## Motivations

### Why Target Victor?
1. **Church Orders**: Church of Eternal Light detected Victor's Galactic Exchange mana signature
2. **Pre-emptive Strike**: Prevent Victor from flooding miracle market (threatens Church monopoly)
3. **Timing**: Acted within 12 hours of Victor listing [Miracle: Rain]

### Why Use Kade?
- Deniability (contract can't be traced directly to Church)
- Disposable asset (if Kade fails, Church loses nothing)
- Cost-effective (25k GP bounty cheaper than direct Church intervention)

---

## Current Status (Chapter 90)

### Immediate Problems
1. **Lost Asset**: Kade's Company now works for Victor
2. **Exposed Connection**: Victor knows he's a Church proxy
3. **Incoming Threat**: Victor announced intention to "visit" him

### Victor's Leverage
> "If I publish that Vex is a Church proxy, every smuggler from here to Oakhaven will stop doing business with him. His company collapses in 48 hours."

Vex's options:
- **Option A**: Sell Church contacts to Victor (survival via cooperation)
- **Option B**: Refuse and face market destruction

---

## Intelligence Assessment

### Threat Level
- **Combat**: Low (merchant, not combatant)
- **Economic**: Moderate (controls southern smuggling routes)
- **Political**: High (Church connection = access to divine resources)

### Value as Asset
If Victor acquires Vex's smuggling network:
- Access to Church intelligence
- Southern trade route control
- Smuggling infrastructure for Galactic Exchange arbitrage

---

## Predicted Outcome

**Victor's Strategy**: Force acquisition via leverage (exposure threat)

**Likely Result**:
1. Vex sells Church contact list to avoid exposure
2. Victor absorbs Blackwood Trading Company assets
3. Vex becomes informant or liquidated (depending on cooperation level)

**Church Response**: Unknown (Vex is disposable; they may cut ties)

---

## Relationships

### Victor Kaine
- **Status**: Hostile (target turned hunter)
- **Awareness**: Knows Victor has 42-soldier security force
- **Fear Level**: High (Victor weaponizes information, not violence)

### Church of Eternal Light
- **Status**: Contractor (proxy relationship)
- **Loyalty**: Conditional (paid for services)
- **Expendability**: High (Church will abandon if exposed)

### Kade's Company
- **Status**: Former contractor (now enemy)
- **Consequence**: Lost primary security asset

---

## Notes

- First antagonist defeated without combat (contract law exploit)
- Represents Church's underestimation of Victor's capabilities
- Sets pattern: Victor converts enemies into assets or intelligence sources
