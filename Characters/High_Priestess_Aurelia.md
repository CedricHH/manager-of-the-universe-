## Character Overview

Aurelia is a zealot who believes the Dungeon is an "Abomination." Unlike Vorne (who wanted a bribe) or Aldric (who wants tax revenue), Aurelia cannot be bought. She is a true believer.

She possesses a "Divine Compass" that can detect high-level magical anomalies—specifically World Cores.

### Key Traits
- **Fanatical**: "You monetize suffering."
- **Perceptive**: Smelled "death" and "greed" immediately.
- **Powerful**: Summoned a Sun-Construct that required Victor's "Disco Protocol" to neutralize.

## Recent Developments (Chapter 60)

- **The Inspection**: Challenged Victor's defenses. Summoned a Sun-Construct to "test" the facility.
- **Humiliation**: Her Construct was neutralized by prismatic slime gel ("The Disco Protocol"), making her look foolish in front of the Prince.
- **The Discovery**: At the end of Ch 60, her compass detected the World Core (Nova). She is currently standing outside the Core Room, preparing to breach.
- **Status**: **CRITICAL THREAT**. About to engage.
