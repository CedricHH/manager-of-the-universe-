## The Church's Face

Aurelia is what Elara was supposed to become:
- True believer (on the surface)
- Perfect public image
- Completely ruthless beneath

She knows the Church is corrupt. She doesn't care. Power is power.

## Why She Hates Victor

Victor threatens the Church's monopoly on hope:
- His "Prosperity Doctrine" (work hard, get rewards) competes with faith
- He employs former Church members
- Elara (her former subordinate) works for him

It's personal AND economic.

## Arc

- Arc 2: First confrontation; Church investigates Victor
- Arc 3: Church allies with Kingdom against Victor
- Arc 4: Church collapses; Aurelia becomes desperate
- Final: Either dies or has a redemption moment?

## Speech Pattern

Silky, threatening, pious:

> "The Light sees all, Manager. Even the darkness in your ledgers."

> "You think gold matters? Souls are the true currency."

> "Elara was our failure. You collected our trash. How fitting."
