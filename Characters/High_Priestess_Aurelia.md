## Character Overview

Aurelia is a zealot who believes the Dungeon is an "Abomination." Unlike Vorne (who wanted a bribe) or Aldric (who wants tax revenue), Aurelia cannot be bought. She is a true believer.

She possesses a "Divine Compass" that can detect high-level magical anomalies—specifically World Cores.

### Key Traits
- **Fanatical**: "You monetize suffering."
- **Perceptive**: Smelled "death" and "greed" immediately.
- **Powerful**: Summoned a Sun-Construct that required Victor's "Disco Protocol" to neutralize.
