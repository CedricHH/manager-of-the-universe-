## Basic Information

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Aurelia (Last name: Solhaven - rarely used) |
| **Title** | High Priestess (Cathedral District, Sunspire Cathedral) |
| **Level** | 26 |
| **Organization** | Church of Eternal Light |

---

## Character Evolution

**Note**: Aurelia's character significantly evolved from early plans. Originally conceived as a zealot antagonist (Chapters 59-61 outline), she became a **pragmatic institutional player** in the actual story (Chapters 91-100).

**Why the Change?**  
Victor's strategy shifted from confrontation to **institutional partnership**. Aurelia adapted to this reality - she represents Church **pragmatism** over fanaticism.

---

## Appearance

**Physical Description**:
- Height: Nearly 6 feet
- Build: Commanding presence
- Eyes: Gold (divine authority manifestation)
- Attire: **Golden vestments embedded with divine crystals** (displays status + power)
- Aura: Divine mana visibly crackles around hands when agitated

**Intimidation Factor**: Aurelia uses physical presence strategically - stands to tower over negotiation partners, radiates divine power during confrontations.

## Background & Church Crisis

### Church Declining Miracle Production
Aurelia presides over miracle production during a critical decline:
- **Historical Success Rate**: 90% (decades ago)
- **Current Success Rate**: 65% (catastrophic decline)
- **Cause**: Divine mana depletion, unknown theological crisis

This decline created desperation - Victor's Galactic Exchange miracle brokerage became **strategically critical** to Church operations.

### Internal Church Rivalry
Aurelia competes with the **Archbishop of Westmarch** for continental influence. Her miracle production shortfall gives him leverage. Victor's brokerage deal was as much about **internal Church politics** as economics.

**Key Quote (Ch 96)**:
> "If your Consortium terminates your contract, my sourcing arrangement collapses. I lose vendor access. And the Archbishop of Westmarch—my political rival—gains leverage. I'd rather take fifteen percent commission than zero miracles and his smugness."

## Relationship with Victor Kaine

### First Meeting (Chapter 91-95)
- Church paladins detained Victor for "unauthorized miracle trading"
- Aurelia saw opportunity: Victor's Exchange access could solve Church's supply crisis
- Initial proposal: 50/50 partnership (Victor supplies, Church distributes)

### Negotiation Evolution (Chapter 96)

**Round 1 - 50/50 Partnership**:
- Victor delivers miracles wholesale
- Church resells at markup
- Revenue split 50/50 (90,000 GP/month to Victor)

**Problem**: G.A.C. flagged this as "dependency relationship" violation

**Round 2 - Brokerage Model (15% Commission)**:
- Victor facilitates vendor introductions
- Church purchases directly from Exchange vendors
- Victor earns 15% facilitation commission (27,000 GP/month)
- **Church retains operational independence** (no dependency)

**Why Aurelia Accepted**: "Fifteen percent of something sustainable beats zero miracles and political humiliation."

---

## Personality (Actual)

**Core Traits**:
- **Pragmatist**: Treats Church partnership as business arrangement, not theological mission
- **Politically Aware**: Understands institutional power dynamics (Archbishop rivalry)
- **Intimidation Tactics**: Uses physical presence + divine power displays strategically
- **Mutual Respect with Victor**: Recognizes he plays similar institutional games

**Key Dynamic**: Aurelia and Victor negotiate as **equals** - both understand systemic pressures, both maneuver within institutional constraints.

**Not a Zealot**: Despite appearances (golden vestments, divine power), Aurelia operates like a CEO protecting market share, not a fanatic crusader.

## Abilities

**Divine Authority (Level 26)**:
- Command over paladins and church infrastructure
- Divine mana manifestation (visible crackling energy)
- Miracle production (reduced efficacy - 65% success rate)
- Institutional authority (can declare heresy, seize assets)

**Negotiation Leverage**:
- Legal authority to arrest Victor
- Church military (paladins, inquisitors)
- Continental influence (thousands of believers)

**Weakness**: Supply dependency - without Victor's brokerage, miracle revenue collapses.

---

## Key Quotes

1. **"And if I refuse? If I declare you heretic and seize your assets?"** (Intimidation tactic - testing Victor's resolve)

2. **"Fifteen percent commission. Church requires premium facilitation services."** (Counter-negotiation - won't accept 12%, demands 15%)

3. **"You reduced your earnings significantly, Mr. Kaine. Why?"**  
   Victor: "Because earning sixty percent of zero is worse than earning fifteen percent of something sustainable."  
   Aurelia: "Pragmatic. As always."

4. **"I'd rather take fifteen percent than zero miracles and his [Archbishop's] smugness."** (Reveals political vulnerability)

## Role in Arc 1 (Chapters 91-100)

### Chapter 91-95: The Coalition Crisis
- Church confronts Victor for selling miracles (threatens Church monopoly)
- Aurelia sees opportunity instead of threat
- Partnership negotiations begin

### Chapter 96: The Cathedral
- Victor negotiates 50/50 partnership at Sunspire Cathedral
- Aurelia initially holds leverage (can arrest Victor)
- Victor demonstrates value (vendor access, Exchange expertise)
- Agreement reached: 50/50 partnership (later restructured)

### Chapter 97: The Restructure
- Victor restructures to 15% brokerage due to G.A.C. policy
- Aurelia accepts via message (pragmatic decision)
- Meeting at Cathedral Annex confirms revised terms

**Final Status**: Active Church partnership (15% commission on ~180k GP/month transactions = 27k GP to Victor)

---

## Strategic Importance

**For Victor**:
- Steady revenue stream (27k GP/month)
- Institutional legitimacy (Church backing)
- Protection from Church persecution (partner vs. heretic)

**For Aurelia**:
- Reliable miracle supply (solves 65% success rate crisis)
- Political survival (Archbishop can't exploit miracle shortage)
- Revenue generation (miracle markup after commission)

**Mutual Dependency**: Despite "brokerage independence," both sides need partnership to succeed. Victor needs income; Aurelia needs supply.

---

## Arc 2 Potential

**Unresolved Threads**:
1. **Archbishop Rivalry**: Will he challenge Aurelia's partnership with Victor?
2. **Divine Decline**: What's causing Church's 65% miracle success rate crisis?
3. **Institutional Integration**: Does partnership risk Church orthodoxy?

**Conflict Potential**:
- If Victor's Exchange operations draw Church scrutiny
- If Archbishop politicizes the partnership
- If divine decline worsens (Aurelia needs Victor more = leverage shift)

**Last Updated**: Arc 1 Complete (Chapter 96-97)
