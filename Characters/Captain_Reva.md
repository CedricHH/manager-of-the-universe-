## Backstory

The Shattered Isles recognize no king. Only the strongest captain rules.

Reva killed seventeen captains to claim her throne. She runs the largest smuggling network on the planet.

When kingdoms formed alliances against Victor, she saw opportunity.

## Why She Matters

Victor controls land. Reva controls **sea lanes**.

Neither can destroy the other without catastrophic cost. So they negotiate.

> "You want my ships? Fine. But I want something kingdoms can't give me."
> "Name it."
> "Legitimacy. Make me a *legal* trade empire."

Victor does. The Stormborn Trading Company is born.

## Psychology

### Ruthless Pragmatist

Reva isn't evil. She's a survivor. The sea doesn't care about morality—only results.

She respects Victor because he thinks the same way.

### The Exception

She has one weakness: Her daughter (hidden on a remote island). Victor knows but never leverages it.

This confuses her. And makes her more loyal.

## Speech Pattern

Rough, direct, sardonic:

> "I've sunk ships for less insult than you're offering."

> "The Holy Alliance calls me 'pirate.' Victor calls me 'logistics partner.' I prefer his vocabulary."

> "You want trust? I trust your greed. That's enough."
