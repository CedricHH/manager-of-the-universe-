## The Fading Empire

The Solarian Dominion was the greatest empire on the continent—200 years ago.

Now it's a relic. Corrupt nobles. Empty treasury. Army on paper only.

Valkorin knows his empire is dying. He's too old to save it.

## Why He Matters

When Victor expands beyond Valdris, Solaria is the first major power he encounters.

Valkorin could fight—and lose everything.

Or he could **invite Victor in**.

> "Conquer me if you must. But consider:
> I have legitimacy you can't buy.
> My dynasty's blessing makes rulers accepted.
> My death makes you a tyrant. My alliance makes you an emperor."

Victor... considers.

## The Deal

Valkorin becomes Victor's "senior advisor" (figurehead).

In exchange, Victor funds Solaria's revival. The empire prospers for the first time in decades.

Valkorin dies in Chapter 750, at peace. His last words:

> "You're a monster. But you kept your contract. That's more than my sons ever did."
