## Character Overview

Aldric is the charming, bored, and secretly desperate face of the Kingdom. He presents as a fop, but he is painfully aware that the Kingdom's treasury is empty. He is not looking for justice; he is looking for **revenue**.

Victor identified him not as a threat, but as a "Distressed Asset" ripe for acquisition.

### Key Traits
- **Fiscally Desperate**: Will ignore "heresy" if the price is right.
- **Bored**: Loves entertainment (the "Dancing Wolves").
- **Corruptible**: Accepted a 15% kickback scheme within 10 minutes of meeting Victor.
