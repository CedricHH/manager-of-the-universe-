## Relations

- **Victor Kaine**: They see him as a terrifying but refreshingly logical manager. He "bought" them from the cast-off pool because he saw their flaws as specialized features. 
- **Senior Partner Hestia**: They are both terrified of her, as she was the one who oversaw their initial "failure" labels.
