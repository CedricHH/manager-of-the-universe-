## Appearance

- **Age**: Mid-30s
- **Distinctive Feature**: Missing left ear (combat injury)

- **Build**: Lean, scarred, professional combatant

---

## Background

### Military Service
- **Former Role**: Imperial scout (discharged dishonorably)
- **Reason**: Unknown (Victor calculated 87% probability of dishonorable discharge based on equipment retention)
- **Skills Retained**: Tactical spacing, crossfire positioning, escape route planning

### Mercenary Career
- Formed sellsword company after discharge
- 42 soldiers (average Level 12)
- Reputation: Competent but morally flexible
- **Fatal Mistake**: Accepted a magically-binding contract with a suicide clause from Merchant Vex

## Chapter 90: The Contract Transfer

### The Ambush
- **Mission**: Capture Victor Kaine alive for 25,000 GP bounty (hired by Merchant Vex)
- **Contract Type**: Magically binding with suicide clause (mana-core burns out if mission fails)
- **Target**: Victor Kaine (en route to Oakhaven)

### The Negotiation
- Victor offered 30,000 GP to hire Kade instead of fighting
- Kade refused (contract binding prevented betrayal)
- Victor exploited **Transfer Clause** (Section F, Subsection 9)
- Used [Contract Override Token] (5,000 GP, purchased from Galactic Exchange)
- Contract forcibly transferred from Vex to Victor

### The Result
- **New Employer**: Victor Kaine
- **New Mission**: Security Detail (The Gilded Caravan)
- **Compensation**: 30,000 GP lump sum + 100 GP/month per soldier
- **Duration**: 6 months (renewable)
- **Benefits**: Dental coverage (first time in his career)

### Emotional Impact
> "For the first time in three months, he could breathe without calculating his remaining hours."

The binding sigil remains on his chest, but the pressure—the burning threat of mana-core failure—is gone.

---

## Psychology

- **Pragmatic**: "Business is business" (accepts contracts based on payment, not morality)
- **Tired**: Three months under a suicide-clause contract wore him down
- **Loyal (Conditional)**: Will honor contracts if terms are clear and fair
- **Underestimated Victor**: "You can't just negotiate your way out of an ambush."
- **Learning**: Beginning to understand that Victor plays by different rules

---

## Relationships

### Victor Kaine
- **Status**: Employer (through contract transfer)
- **Respect Level**: High (Victor saved his life by removing suicide clause)
- **Confusion Level**: Also high ("Did we just get hired by the guy we were supposed to kidnap?")
- **First Assignment**: Confront Merchant Vex (former employer)

### Merchant Vex
- **Status**: Former employer (hostile)
- **Resentment**: Moderate (Vex used a suicide clause—poor management)
- **Current Stance**: Willing to confront if Victor orders it
