## Role in Story

Vorne represents the Guild's bureaucratic arm — not a warrior, but an investigator. He's the first opponent Victor can't simply outmaneuver with contracts or intimidation. He plays by the rules, which makes him dangerous.

He exists to show:
1. Victor's "weaponized transparency" strategy in action
2. The jurisdictional vulnerability (Sterling permits vs Crown authority)
3. Competent opposition that isn't easily dismissed

## Psychology

### Core Traits

- **By-the-Book**: Follows procedures precisely. No shortcuts, no compromises.
- **Thorough**: Noted Victor's permit vulnerability despite finding no other evidence.
- **Professional**: Not personally hostile — just doing his job.
- **Clever**: Threw Victor's "We're very thorough" line back at him.

### The Dynamic

Vorne came expecting a monster den. He found a corporate office. This confused him, but didn't stop him from finding the one real vulnerability: the jurisdictional loophole.

---

## Speech Pattern

Clipped, professional, bureaucratic:

> "You knew we were here." (Statement, not question)

> "Unlicensed dungeon operation in this jurisdiction."

> "Sterling's permits are provisional. They don't supersede Guild jurisdiction."

> "We're very thorough. Expect formal proceedings within the month."

## Recent Developments (Chapter 50)

### Chapter 50: The Audit
- Conducted official investigation of Insolvia Holdings
- Found no evidence of illegal activity (collusion, detention, tax evasion)
- Discovered permit vulnerability: Sterling's territorial authority vs Guild's Crown jurisdiction
- Departed with threat of Crown petition to invalidate permits
- **Status**: Compromised. Forced to certify Insolvia's safety to hide his own illegal kill order.

## Recent Developments (Chapters 56-59)

- **Injunction Failed**: Attempted to close dungeon legally; blocked by Victor's "Class Action" lawsuit (Ch 56).
- **Code Red**: Ordered Crimson Blades to "Liquidate" Victor after failing to find violations. This order was recorded (Ch 57).
- **The Settlement**: Forced to sign a 6-month Safety Compliance Certificate to prevent Victor from releasing the kill-order footage (Ch 59).
