## Character Introduction (Chapter 38)

- **Professional Surveillance**: Monitored Victor's waypoint activation; assessed as "interesting" variable
- **Breakfast Meeting**: Initiated contact at The Silver Standard inn; direct, efficient approach
- **Information Gathering**: Already researched Victor (Sterling endorsement, dungeon claims, Consortium backing verified)
- **Assessment Question**: "Are you competition, or opportunity?"

---

## Guild Business Proposal

**The Problem**: Alchemist Cartel monopoly (inflated prices, strangled innovation, 20-year dominance)

**The Solution**: Victor floods market with dungeon-sourced reagents → collapses Cartel pricing

**The Deal**:
- Victor: Wage economic war on Cartel, provide quarterly briefings, submit performance documentation
- Guild: Full membership, trade routes, regulatory protection, operational flexibility

**Terms**: 2-week deadline for documentation (revenue reports, casualty metrics, efficiency data)

---

## Character Traits

### Professional Competence
- "Guild protection of commerce" (market stability focus, not bureaucracy)
- Methodical researcher (verified Sterling partnership, investigated claims)
- Risk/reward calculator (supports Victor's unorthodox methods if proven effective)

### Pragmatism
- Willing to "bend regulations" for economic benefit
- Recognizes Victor's corporate warfare expertise
- Values documentation over promises

### Information Leverage
- Dropped Previous Restructurer mystery then left (maintains information advantage)
- Strategic timing (breakfast meeting = neutral ground, time pressure)

---

## Key Intelligence Shared

**Alchemist Cartel Connections**:
- Church hierarchy
- Noble families  
- Adventurer Guild officers (on payroll)
- **Tactics**: Legal challenges, sabotage, hired accidents

**Previous Restructurer**:
- Arrived 16 years ago (young woman, "unpronounceable" name)
- Tried establishing Consortium operations
- Disappeared after 3 months (circumstances unknown)
- Guild lacks jurisdiction to investigate Consortium affairs

---

## Dialogue Style

Direct, clinical, information-focused:
> "When someone brings century-dead infrastructure online, I want to know if they're opportunity or threat."

> "That's not bending regulations. That's inventing new ones."

> "I believe you." [Drops mystery] "Just... be aware."

---

## Strategic Function
