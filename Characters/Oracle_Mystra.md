## The Curse

Mystra sees the future. All of it. Always.

This sounds like a gift. It's not.

She sees every death. Every betrayal. Every war that will happen. She cannot stop any of it.

She went mad centuries ago. Now she's... numb.

## Why Victor Matters

Mystra cannot see Victor's future clearly.

The ARMI system interferes with prophecy. Victor is a statistical anomaly—his choices break prediction models.

For the first time in centuries, Mystra sees **uncertainty**.

This terrifies her. And fascinates her.

## Role

Victor consults her for strategic information.

She gives him fragments—always accurate, always incomplete.

> "You will face three betrayals before the throne."
> "Who betrays me?"
> "...That, I cannot tell. Or will not. Even I'm uncertain which."

## The Question She Asks

> "I've seen empires rise and fall for a thousand years.
> Yours will fall too. They all do.
> Why do you still try?"

Victor's answer changes over the story.
