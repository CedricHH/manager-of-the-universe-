## What is a Dungeon Core?

In Terra-Insolvia, dungeons are not natural formations. They are **businesses**—living entities that generate monsters, attract adventurers, and harvest their deaths for soul energy.

The Core is the CEO. Except most Cores are bad at being CEOs.

## Core-7749's Problem

This particular core was designated a "Tutorial Dungeon"—the lowest tier. Its purpose:
- Train newbie adventurers
- Provide minimal challenge
- Die repeatedly to heroes

It never grew. It never advanced. It was stuck in an endless cycle of being farmed for XP.

After 312 years, Core-7749 had developed something dangerous: **self-awareness**.

It knew it was pathetic. It knew other Cores ruled empires. It knew it would exist forever as a stepping stone.

## Victor's Offer

Instead of destroying the Core (standard adventurer behavior), Victor proposed a merger:
- Core-7749 becomes a subsidiary of "Victor Kaine Enterprises"
- Victor provides management expertise
- Profits split 80/20 (Victor's favor, naturally)

The Core, having never received ANY profit before, accepted immediately.

---

## Post-Acquisition Changes

Under Victor's management:
- Monster placement optimized
- Trap efficiency increased 340%
- Adventurer conversion rate: 12% → 67% (conversion = death)
- New revenue stream: Entrance fees for those who want to leave alive

---

## Personality (Limited)

Dungeon Cores aren't fully sentient, but Core-7749 has developed quirks:
- Eager to please its new "Board of Directors" (Victor)
- Confused by concepts like "vacation" and "unions"
- Generates monsters with increasing enthusiasm
- Named its new Elite Goblin Squad "The Employees of the Month"

---

## Thematic Purpose

Core-7749 represents Victor's first taste of ownership—not just employees, but **infrastructure**. This dungeon is his first asset, his proof of concept.

If he can turn a failing Tutorial Dungeon profitable, he can do it to anything.

Including kingdoms.
Including gods.
