## Basic Information

| Attribute | Value |

| **First Appearance** | Chapter 105 |

---

## Backstory

Groll built his guild from nothing. 45 years of work, bribes, and ruthlessness made him the sole supplier of potions in Oakhaven.

His prices are extortionate. His quality is mediocre. His monopoly is unbreakable.

Until Victor arrived.

---

## Psychology

### The Irony

Groll is **everything Victor could have been** if Victor had stayed small.
- Built monopoly through exploitation
- Crushed competitors without mercy  
- Hoards wealth, reinvests nothing
- Believes his empire is permanent

His fatal flaw: He can't imagine someone better at his own game.

### Pride Over Survival

When Victor offers to buy the guild, Groll refuses.

> "I built this! FORTY-FIVE YEARS! You're nothing but a dungeon rat!"

He'd rather burn than bend.

---

## The Confrontation

Victor doesn't fight Groll. He **out-competes** him:
- Cheaper potions
- Better quality
- Exposed tax fraud
- Guild members defect

By Chapter 200, Groll owns a bankrupt shell.

Victor buys it for 1 gold. Groll is not offered a position.

---

## Fate

Groll dies in obscurity (Chapter 240), bitter and broke.

**Victor's comment**: "He protected his pride instead of his assets. Inefficient."

---

## Thematic Purpose

Groll shows what happens when you **fight** Victor's methods instead of adapting. He also mirrors Victor's former self—a monopolist who believes power is permanent.

## Recent Developments (Chapter 39)

## Recent Developments (Chapter 41)
