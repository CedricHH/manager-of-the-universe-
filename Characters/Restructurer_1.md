## Overview

Restructurer #1 was the first agent sent by the **Galactic Audit Consortium** to Terra-Insolvia. Initially committed to "salvaging" the world through economic optimization, they eventually discovered the "Harvest" protocol and turned against their employers.

## History

- **Arrival**: Approximately 2,000 years ago.
- **Mission**: Restructure Terra-Insolvia's primitive economy.
- **Conflict**: Recieved "liquidation metrics" and "population reduction targets" that revealed the world was a farm scheduled for harvest.
- **The Sabotage**: Hid the processing activation codes and built a hidden Vault beneath Floor 3 of the Tutorial Dungeon.
- **Death**: Isolated and starved after the Consortium terminated ARMI support for insubordination.

## Legacy Assets

- **The Crystal Archive**: A repository of 847 personal logs documenting the world's transition and the Consortium's betrayal.
- **The Black Card**: A Priority Asset Transfer Notice left as leverage for a successor.
- **The Vault**: A high-security chamber containing pre-Consortium era technology and research.

## Personnel Notes (Victor's Assessment)

> "R#1 made the mistake of becoming emotionally invested in the 'assets.' They tried to be a martyr instead of a negotiator. A strategic failure that led to a predictable outcome. I'll take their data, but I won't follow their path to the grave."
