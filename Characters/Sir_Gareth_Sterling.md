## Role in Story

Gareth is Lord Sterling's "expendable" nephew—sent on reconnaissance missions that the Lord himself is too busy (or too cautious) to undertake. He represents the younger generation of Sterling nobility: arrogant, entitled, but ultimately a pawn.

He serves as:
1. First direct Sterling family contact beyond Lord Reginald
2. A messenger/envoy for Victor's partnership expansion proposal
3. Example of how Victor handles high-status "whales"

## Psychology

### Core Traits

- **Entitled**: Third-generation wealth, never earned anything
- **Proud**: His name is his identity; humiliation stings
- **Calculating**: Despite arrogance, capable of recognizing opportunities
- **Subservient** (to Lord Sterling): Fears his uncle's disappointment more than death

### The Dynamic

Gareth came to the dungeon expecting an easy conquest—something to brag about at court. Instead, he was charged entry fees, led through a tourist attraction, and ended up at a negotiating table.

His pride demands revenge. His pragmatism demands he deliver Victor's proposal.

---

## Speech Pattern

Pompous, haughty, increasingly desperate when cornered:

> "You will regret this."

> "I'm going to kill you." / "You're going to sit down."

> "Whatever you're selling, my uncle will dismember you."
