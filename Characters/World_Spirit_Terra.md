## The Awakening

Planets have spirits. Most sleep eternally.

Victor's economic activity—the sheer VOLUME of mana/gold circulation—woke Terra-Insolvia.

She's confused. Curious. NEW to consciousness.

---

## Why She Matters

Terra-Insolvia realizes: Without Victor, she would have been "liquidated" by the Consortium.

An unprofitable world. Scheduled for resource extraction.

**Victor made her valuable.** Victor saved her existence.

---

## The Alliance

Terra offers Victor something unprecedented:

Access to planetary mana. Direct connection to the world's core.

In exchange: Victor protects her from the Consortium.

> "You gave me purpose. You made me WORTH EXISTING.
> I will be your... what is the word? Asset? Ally? Friend?"
> "Partner. Equal shareholding."
> "...I like that better."

---

## Role

Terra represents:
- Victor's accidental positive impact
- Planetary-scale resources
- The moral question: Did he save her? Or exploit her?

---

## Speech Pattern

Young, curious, vast:

> "I have existed for four billion years. I have been AWAKE for three. This is... strange."

> "There are beings beneath my skin. Millions. They move and build and die. Is that... normal?"

> "The Auditors wish to harvest me. You wish to develop me. Both use me. But you ASK first."
