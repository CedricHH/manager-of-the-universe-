## What is the Void Mother?

Before there were Auditors, before there were gods, before there was ANYTHING...

There was the Void.

The Void Mother is entropy personified. Decay. Ending. The natural conclusion of all things.

**She doesn't destroy. She WAITS.**

---

## Why She Matters

Victor's system requires **growth**. Expansion. More markets, more production, more.

The Void Mother represents the ultimate truth: **All systems end.**

She's not an antagonist who attacks. She's a philosophical challenge.

> "You build. I unmake. You optimize. I decay. You grow. I wait.
> In the end, I always win. 
> So why do you try?"

## The Confrontation

Victor cannot fight entropy. No one can.

But he can... **negotiate?**

The Void Mother has never been CONTRACTED. Never been offered TERMS.

What would entropy want in exchange for delays?

---

## Speech Pattern

Slow, inevitable, almost gentle:

> "All your gold will rust. All your contracts will fade. I am patient."

> "You offer me... a deal? In fourteen billion years, no one has offered me a DEAL."

> "Interesting. You are the first to treat inevitability as a... negotiating partner."
