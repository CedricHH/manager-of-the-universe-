## Background

### Consortium Role

Kira is a **Liaison-class Restructurer**—a rare designation within the Galactic Audit Consortium hierarchy. Unlike standard Operators (acquisition/restructuring specialists like Victor), Liaisons serve as:

- **Evaluators**: Assess other Restructurers' performance
- **Overseers**: Monitor compliance with Consortium protocols
- **Recruiters**: Identify candidates for advanced operations
- **Enforcers**: Have authority to terminate underperforming agents

Her presence in Oakhaven indicates Victor has attracted high-level Consortium attention—either positive or problematic.

## Arc 2 History

### Chapter 101 - The Expansion Plan

- **Mana Signature Detected**: Victor's ARMI identified Restructurer-class energy in Market Quarter
- **First Visual Contact**: Victor tracked her to Thorne's Alchemical Supplies
- **The Test**: Kira picked up slime core sample, then turned and smiled at Victor
- **Signature Suppression**: She vanished her mana signature deliberately
- **Assessment**: Noted Victor "doesn't chase bait" (smart tactical discipline)

### Chapter 102 - The Recruitment

- **Encrypted Message**: Sent Consortium protocol message to Victor
- **Self-Identification**: Restructurer #418 (Kira, Designation: Liaison)
- **Meeting Request**: Broken Barrel Inn, noon (next day)
- **Authority Revealed**: "I'm here to evaluate" + has termination authority
- **Research Demonstrated**: Knows Victor's "Chainsaw" nickname from Earth career
- **Victor's Response**: Accepted meeting ("I don't take orders well")

### Chapter 103 - The Liaison

- **Face-to-Face Meeting**: Broken Barrel Inn, noon. Kira arrived before Victor (tactical one-upmanship).
- **Authority Display**: Revealed termination clearance upfront ("corrective action" = termination if needed).
- **Personal History Revealed**: Former record-holder (67 days to 1M GP). Victor broke her record at 23 days.
- **Consortium Lecture**: Explained tier structure (Tier 1: 73% fail, Tier 2: 46%, Tier 3: 12%, Tier 4: classified).
- **Current Position**: Tier 3 (Continental Management), earned promotion through exceptional Arc 1 performance.
- **BROKEN CROWN Mission**: Offered Tier 4 mission to Victor (Terra-Solvaris, 5-way civil war, 12M GP at stake).
  - Previous failures: 4 dead, 3 broken
  - Proposed team: Victor (Lead), Kira (Liaison), 2 unknowns
  - Reward: Skip Tier 2, instant Tier 3 promotion
  - Risk: 57% death probability
- **Psychological Assessment**: Stated Victor's psych profile ("sociopath with guilt complex") as qualification for mission.
- **Intelligence**: Warned Victor that Groll will discover Marcus Thiel's defection in 3 days (timeline acceleration needed).
- **Decision Deadline**: 2 weeks for Victor to decide on BROKEN CROWN.
- **Victor's Response**: Deferred decision to finish Guild War first (Kira predicted this outcome).
- **Personal Log** (private): Kira predicts Victor will accept BROKEN CROWN eventually (87% confidence). "Let's see if you drown."

## Evaluation Purpose (Speculative)

### Possible Reasons for Kira's Presence:

1. **Performance Review** (54% probability - Victor's assessment):
   - Victor achieved 1.022M GP in 23 days (top 8% of Restructurers)
   - Consortium may evaluate high performers for promotion

2. **Compliance Audit** (23% probability):
   - Victor bent/broke Consortium rules during miracle arbitrage
   - Probation was lifted, but permanent monitoring possible

3. **Recruitment** (18% probability):
   - Kira may be recruiting Victor for larger Consortium operation
   - "Liaison" role suggests coordination/team-building function

4. **Termination Risk** (5% probability):
   - If Victor violated protocols, Kira has authority to liquidate him
   - Her friendliness suggests this is unlikely

## Threat Assessment (Victor's Analysis)

### Strengths:
- Consortium authority (can terminate Restructurers)
- Information advantage (knows Victor's background)
- Strategic positioning (chose meeting terms)
- Unknown capabilities (combat/skills unclear)

### Weaknesses:
- Revealed herself openly (confidence or necessity?)
- Approaching Victor suggests she needs something (negotiation leverage)
- "Evaluate" implies observation period (Victor has time to prepare)

### Overall Threat Level: **MODERATE-HIGH**

Not an immediate enemy, but has power to end Victor's Consortium contract (and possibly his life).

## Psychology & Behavior Patterns

### Communication Pattern:
- Prefers direct contact over subterfuge
- Tests competence before engagement
- Respects tactical discipline ("He doesn't chase bait")
- Uses encrypted channels (professional, not paranoid)

### Operating Style:
- Surveillance first, contact second
- Allows target to demonstrate capabilities
- Chooses public meeting location (Broken Barrel Inn = neutral ground)
- Demands Victor come alone (testing trust/courage)

### Likely Goals:
- Assess Victor's capabilities in-person
- Determine if Victor is asset or liability
- Deliver Consortium message/mission
- Possibly recruit Victor for joint operation

## Arc 2 Role (Projected)

### Function in Narrative:

- **Foil to Victor**: Another competent professional, matches his analytical approach
- **Consortium Representative**: Gives face to the organization that employed Victor
- **Wildcard Ally**: Sometimes helps, sometimes restricts, always enigmatic
- **Information Source**: Knows Consortium politics Victor doesn't
- **Potential Obstacle**: Has authority to shut down Victor's operations

### Narrative Arc:
- **Phase 1** (Ch 101-103): Mystery → Contact → Evaluation
- **Phase 2** (Mid-Arc 2): Partnership or Rivalry established
- **Phase 3** (Late Arc 2): Kira's true mission revealed
