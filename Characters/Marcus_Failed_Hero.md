## The Original Hero

Marcus was SUPPOSED to save the world.

The gods chose him. The prophecy named him. He had the sword, the blessing, the destiny.

He died in the Tutorial Dungeon. Chapter 1. Page 1.

Victor looted his corpse.

---

## Why He Matters

Marcus represents the NORMAL isekai story—the one that should have happened.

His failure created the vacuum Victor fills.

---

## Later Appearances

### Flashback/Vision (Ch 100)
Victor sees Marcus's last moments through ARMI data recovery:
- Marcus was arrogant
- Assumed Tutorial = Easy
- Died to a trap he didn't bother checking

**Victor's thought**: "He failed because he trusted the narrative. I don't."

### Ghost/System Echo? (Ch 400+)
Possibility: Marcus's "soul data" is stored somewhere. Could Victor... acquire it?

---

## Speech (From Data Recovery)

> "A Tutorial Dungeon? Please. I'm the Chosen One. What could possibly—"
> [DATA ENDS]

---

## Thematic Purpose

Marcus is what happens when you rely on destiny instead of competence.

Victor is what happens when you have no destiny and only competence.
