## The Twist

Demons aren't chaotic. They're **corporate**.

The Demon Realm is the oldest corporation in existence:
- Hierarchical management structure
- Soul contracts (literally binding)
- Expansion through "hostile takeovers" (invasions)
- 10,000 years of market experience

Malachar isn't a monster. He's Victor's **true equal**—a CEO who's been playing this game for millennia.

## Psychology

### Ancient Patience

Malachar has seen civilizations rise and fall. He doesn't rush. He doesn't panic. He's outlived every opponent for 10,000 years.

Victor is... interesting. The first mortal in centuries to understand the game.

### Respect

Malachar doesn't hate Victor. He respects him.

> "You're the first human in 3,000 years to negotiate with me instead of attack.
> This doesn't mean I won't destroy you. It means I'll enjoy the process."

## The Confrontation

Victor cannot out-fight demons. He cannot out-experience Malachar.

He must find another angle:
- Demon realm has **supply issues** (souls are limited)
- Victor offers alternative: Contracted living workers
- "Why harvest souls when you can lease labor?"

The negotiation spans 50 chapters (681-730).

---

## Outcome

Not enemies. Not allies.

**Business partners with extremely detailed contracts.**

---

## Visual Design

- Appears as handsome, middle-aged businessman
- Perfect suit (older than most kingdoms)
- Eyes that calculate across centuries
- Speaks softly; doesn't need to shout

---

## Speech Pattern

Ancient, measured, vaguely amused:

> "You threaten me? How delightful. The last one to threaten me was a god. He's not a god anymore."

> "Your contract is adequate. The clause structure in section 47 is elegant. You studied, didn't you?"

> "I could destroy you. But destruction is expensive. Let's discuss alternatives."
