## Role

Roland is not there to fight. He is there to **exist**. He is a living blockade. His presence makes illegal/dark activities impossible by default because his [Aura of Truth] and High Perception make it impossible to sneak past him.

### Traits
- **The Stare**: Can stare at a wall for 12 hours without blinking.
- **The Filter**: Adventurers with high "Sin" or bounties refuse to go near him.
- **Speech**: Rarely speaks. When he does, it is usually a death threat phrased as a statement of fact.

- **The Blockade**: His presence caused a temporary 100% drop in customers until Victor rebranded him as a "Security Feature."
