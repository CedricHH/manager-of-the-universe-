## Arc 2 History

### Chapter 104 - The Harvest (First Appearance)

**Receives Report on Unlicensed Shop**:
- Guild Inspector reports new apothecary (Insolvia) operating without permit
- Located in Market Quarter (prime Guild territory)
- Selling potions at 10 silver (undercutting licensed vendors)
- No Guild fee payments detected

**Lysander's Analysis**:
- "An unlicensed shop. In my Market Quarter. Undercutting Guild-approved pricing."
- Calculates revenue loss: 15% of Victor's sales = unpaid Guild fees
- Realizes Victor's shop location: "Market entrance... but sourced from dungeon entrance. Clever loophole."

**Immediate Response** (Demonstrates Competence):
1. **Summons Guild Council**: Strategic meeting
2. **Orders Investigation**: Chief Inspector Greymark to assess operation
3. **Legal Review**: Can Guild charter enforce licensing on dungeon-sourced goods?
4. **Fee Calculation**: If forced to accept, can Guild tax dungeon merchants?

**Council Meeting**:
- **Greymark** (enforcement): "The shop is clean. No violations except missing permit."
- **Legal Advisor**: "Dungeon merchants may claim exemption under Crown authority..."
- **Lysander**: "Then we make the Crown choose: Guild revenue or Victor Kaine."

**Greymark's Mission**: Formal licensing demand + fee assessment

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Lysander's Advantages:

1. **Legal Authority**: 38 years of Guild charter precedent
2. **Political Support**: City relies on Guild fees (18% of budget)
3. **Market Control**: Can deny permits, premium locations
4. **Enforcement**: Guild Inspectors backed by city guard
5. **Economic Leverage**: Controls shipping, warehousing, vendor access

### Lysander's Weaknesses:

1. **Dungeon Loophole**: Victor's shop technically on dungeon property (Crown authority)
2. **Public Opinion**: 15% Guild fees unpopular with common merchants
3. **Inflexibility**: Rigid adherence to rules = poor adaptation
4. **Voros Connection**: Major Guild member (Voros) partnered with Victor in Arc 1
5. **Revenue Dependency**: City won't support Guild if fees drop significantly

### Victor vs. Lysander (Comparative Analysis):

| Factor | Lysander | Victor |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Experience** | 38 years institutional | <1 year in this world |
| **Legal Authority** | High (Guild charter) | Medium (dungeon Crown exemption) |
| **Market Control** | Monopoly (licensing) | Outsider (dungeon-based) |
| **Political Power** | High (city partnership) | Low (new merchant) |
| **Flexibility** | Low (bureaucrat) | High (improviser) |
| **Economic Model** | Fee extraction (15%) | Low-price disruption (80% undercut) |

**Verdict**: Legal/Political power (Lysander) vs. Economic disruption (Victor)

---

## Threat Assessment

**To Victor**: HIGH

Lysander represents institutional power through **legal/regulatory** control:
- Can shut down shop via city ordinance
- Can deny shipping contracts, warehouse access
- Can pressure other merchants to boycott Victor
- Has city political backing

**Escalation Path** (Predicted):
1. **Phase 1** (Ch 105): Formal licensing demand + fee assessment
2. **Phase 2**: Legal pressure (city ordinance, Crown petition)
3. **Phase 3**: Economic siege (deny suppliers, shipping, warehouse access)
4. **Phase 4**: Guild-wide boycott (pressure all members to avoid Victor)
5. **Endgame**: Victor either buys Guild influence or finds legal loophole

## Narrative Function

### Role in Arc 2:

- **Primary Antagonist**: Trade War arc (Ch 101-125 projected)
- **Bureaucratic Obstacle**: Represents "regulatory capture" vs. free market disruption
- **Differentiation from Arc 1**: Not about production (Alchemist Guild), but market access/licensing
- **Competent Opposition**: Forces Victor to navigate legal/political systems
- **Eventual Outcome**: Guild reform or Victor's political ascension

### Character Arc (Projected):

1. **Confidence** (Ch 104-105): Assumes licensing authority is absolute
2. **Frustration** (Ch 106-110): Victor exploits legal loopholes
3. **Escalation** (Ch 111-115): Political pressure, economic siege
4. **Realization** (Ch 116-120): Guild system outdated vs. economic efficiency
5. **Resolution** (Ch 121-125): Guild reform or Victor's acquisition

## Differentiation from Arc 1 (Mordecai Groll)

| Aspect | Mordecai Groll (Arc 1) | Lysander Corvus (Arc 2) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Guild** | Alchemist Guild | Merchant Guild |
| **Conflict Type** | Production monopoly | Market access/licensing |
| **Victor's Advantage** | Lower production costs | Dungeon Crown exemption |
| **Escalation** | Debt acquisition | Legal/political warfare |
| **Defeat Method** | Hostile financial takeover | Regulatory reform or influence purchase |
| **Post-Defeat** | Forced into middle management | TBD (Guild reform? Advisory role?) |

**Key Difference**: Arc 1 was **economic** (cheaper production), Arc 2 is **legal/political** (market access rights)
