## The Divine Economy

Gods need worship. Worship = power.

Aurum's problem: Her domain is COMMERCE. People pray to war gods, harvest gods, love gods...

Nobody prays to the god of balanced ledgers.

She's been slowly dying for millennia.

## Victor's Prosperity Doctrine

When Victor's "Prosperity Doctrine" spreads across the world, something happens:

People start praying for **good deals**. For **fair contracts**. For **profitable ventures**.

Aurum's power EXPLODES.

She seeks Victor out.

> "You gave me more followers in ten years than I gained in five thousand."
> "Unintentional."
> "I don't care. How can I help you?"

## The Alliance

Aurum offers divine power in exchange for continued worship generation.

Victor now has a GOD on his payroll.

(The Galactic Audit Consortium is NOT happy about this.)

---

## Psychology

### Desperate Pragmatist

Other gods have pride. Aurum has **survival instincts**.

She'll do anything to not fade away.

### Genuine Gratitude

Victor didn't save her intentionally—but he saved her. She remembers.

## Speech Pattern

Ancient, commercial, oddly cheerful:

> "I'm a god! I can smite your enemies! ...For a reasonable fee."

> "The other gods think I'm selling out. They're also DYING. I'm growing. Who's right?"

> "You want to negotiate with the Cosmic Auditors? Take me with you. I know how to read divine contracts."
