## Origin Story

### Life Before Victor

Sniv was the lowest goblin in his pack—too weak to fight, too ugly to mate, too small to carry loot. His only value was as bait or a distraction during ambushes.

He had never eaten a full meal. He had never slept without fear of being eaten by his own kind.

When Victor appeared, Sniv was three days from starvation.

### The Contract

Victor offered what no one had ever offered: **a deal**.

Food. Safety. In exchange for service.

Sniv didn't understand the words "employment contract" or "probationary period." But he understood the rations Victor laid out. He understood the promise that no one would hit him if he performed well.

He signed. (He made an X. He couldn't write.)

### The Transformation

Under Victor's "management," Sniv discovered he had talents:
- He could count (rare for goblins)
- He could remember faces and grudges
- He understood hierarchies instinctively
- He was absolutely, pathologically loyal to whoever fed him

Victor recognized these as **HR competencies**.

## Psychology

### Core Traits

- **Fanatical Loyalty**: Victor saved him. Victor feeds him. Victor is GOD.
- **Eager to Please**: Will do anything to avoid being "downsized"
- **Learning**: Mimics Victor's corporate speak (often wrong, always funny)
- **Hidden Cruelty**: Treats lesser creatures as he was once treated—unless Victor forbids it

### The Comedy

Sniv takes corporate jargon literally:
- "Fire him" = sets person on fire
- "Cut costs" = attacks expenses with knife
- "Hostile takeover" = immediately violent

He wears a tie (doesn't know why, Victor wears one).
He carries a clipboard (can't read, but it feels important).

|-------|-------|---------|---------|

| Goblin Executive | 51+ | ??? | Unknown, rumored to grow briefcase |

## Skills

| Skill | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Loyal to a Fault** | Cannot betray Victor; takes psychic damage from disloyalty thoughts |
| **Paper Pusher** | +50% efficiency when organizing documents |
| **Performance Review (Basic)** | Can assess goblin-level creatures |
| **Intimidation (Corporate)** | Scares underlings with phrases like "restructuring" |

## Relationships

| Character | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Victor** | Worships him. Would die for him. Would kill for him. |
| **Asterion** | Nervous around him. Too big. Might step on Sniv. |
| **Elara** | Confused. She's nice to him. This is suspicious. |
| **Other Goblins** | They are resources. They are not Sniv. They are expendable. |

## Speech Pattern

Broken common, learning corporate jargon:

> "Boss! Boss! New meat—I mean, *candidates* for position!"

> "Sniv has completed performance reviews. Three need terminating. Sniv can do terminating?"

> "What is '401k'? Is it weapon? Sniv wants 401k!"

> "Synergy! Leverage! Paradigm shift! Did Sniv say words right, Boss?"
