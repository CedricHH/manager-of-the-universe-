## The Intern

The Galactic Audit Consortium has interns.

Echo is the newest. Assigned to document Victor's case.

They're supposed to be neutral. They're supposed to be objective.

They're also really bad at their job.

---

## The Problem

Echo keeps... agreeing with Victor?

> "He's exploiting workers!" (Senior Auditor)
> "But he pays them. We don't pay OUR workers." (Echo)
> "That's... different."
> "Is it though?"

Every interaction with Victor's case makes Echo question the Consortium.

---

## Defection?

Echo doesn't fully defect. They provide "accidental" information leaks.

> "Oh no, I ACCIDENTALLY left this classified file where Victor could find it. 
> How CARELESS of me. 
> ...Again."

---

## Role

Echo represents:
- Humor in cosmic bureaucracy
- New generation questioning old systems
- That even gods have disaffected workers

---

## Speech Pattern

Earnest, confused, accidentally subversive:

> "I'm supposed to document his crimes but... he files better paperwork than WE do?"

> "The Consortium exists to optimize reality. But we have a 4-billion-year backlog. That seems... suboptimal?"

> "I'm not helping Victor! I'm just... very bad at NOT helping him."
