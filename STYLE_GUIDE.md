# Style Guide: The Manager of the Universe

> Project-specific writing rules, tone, and formatting

---

## 1. Core Identity

| Aspect                 | Definition                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Genre**        | LitRPG + Corporate Satire                  |
| **Tone**         | Cynical, sharp, darkly humorous            |
| **POV**          | Victor's analytical inner monologue        |
| **Humor Source** | Juxtaposition (corporate logic in fantasy) |

---

## 2. The Protagonist's Voice

### Victor Kaine's Perspective

Victor does not *feel* emotions—he **calculates risk probabilities**.

**Standard Fantasy:**

> "The dragon breathed fire, and the knight felt terror grip his heart."

**Victor's Voice:**

> "The biological asset (Dragon) expended 50,000 kilojoules of thermal energy. ROI on engagement: negative. The knight's fear response was inefficient—cortisol wastes glucose."

### The Corporate Gaze

| Fantasy Term  | Victor's Translation |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Party members | Human resources      |
| Enemies       | Hostile competitors  |
| Killing       | Liquidating assets   |
| Magic         | Corporate skills     |
| Dungeon       | Distressed property  |
| Boss monster  | Middle management    |

## 3. Dialogue Styles

### Victor (CEO)

Transactional, dominant, uses ultimatums.

> "I'm not offering friendship. I'm offering employment. The alternative is death. Sign here."

### Sniv (Goblin HR)

Worshipful, learning corporate speak, comedic.

> "Boss! The new hires have arrived! Should I... *process* them?"

### Asterion (Minotaur Security)

Depressed middle manager, formal.

> "I have reviewed the contract. The severance package is... acceptable."

### Lady Elara (Unwilling Tank)

Bitter, sarcastic, trapped.

> "Oh, wonderful. Another opportunity to die for someone else's profit margin."

---

## 3b. Contrasting Worldviews

> **IMPORTANT**: Other characters do NOT share Victor's corporate worldview. They see the world through their own lenses.

| Character | Worldview | Sees Victor As |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Victor** | Everything is a transaction | The only sane person |
| **Sniv** | Survival through service; the strong rule | A god who feeds him |
| **Asterion** | Existence needs purpose; order brings peace | A strange master, but one who explains "why" |
| **Elara** | Justice exists; institutions fail it | A monster—but an honest one |
| **Sterling** | Nobility deserves respect; blood matters | An upstart commoner who cheats |

### Writing Contrasting Views

When Elara sees a dungeon, she sees: *a place where people die needlessly*.
When Asterion sees it: *his home, his prison, his function*.
When Victor sees it: *undervalued real estate*.

**This creates dramatic tension**: The same event means different things to each character.

**Example Scene:**
> Victor: "The dungeon's kill rate increased 340%."
> Elara: "Three hundred percent more *deaths*, Victor."
> Victor: "That's what I said."
> Asterion: "...They were adventurers. They chose this."
> Sniv: "Sniv processed the corpses efficiently! Praise for Sniv?"

## 4. System Messages (ARMI)

Use this format for the Apex Resource Management Interface:

```
> **[ARMI]**
> Balance: X GP | Transaction: [ACTION]
> Cost: X GP | Status: APPROVED / DENIED
```

**Example:**

> **[ARMI]**
> Balance: 500 GP | Transaction: [Hostile Takeover]
> Cost: 500 GP | Status: APPROVED
> Note: Target acquired. Daily maintenance: 10 GP.

## 5. Chapter Structure

| Section               | Words      | Content                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Hook**        | 200-300    | Start*In Media Res* or sharp observation |
| **Development** | 1000-1,200 | Victor being competent (Face-Slapping)     |
| **Cliffhanger** | 200-300    | New threat, opportunity, or revelation     |

**Every chapter MUST have:**

- [ ] At least 2 ARMI system messages
- [ ] Corporate jargon used as magic
- [ ] Victor demonstrating competence
- [ ] Cliffhanger ending

## 6. Banned Elements

### Phrases to NEVER Use

- "His heart raced"
- "He couldn't believe it"
- "Suddenly..."
- "For the greater good"

### Tropes to AVOID
