## Missing Syncs (Intentional)

**Not Updated**:
- **Nova.md** - Would need dungeon operations update (Floor 6-10 prep)
- **Asterion.md** - Security role stable, no major changes Ch 92-100
- **Sniv.md** - Role stable (notetaker/documentation)
- **Voros_Thane.md** - Partnership role stable
- **Prince_Aldric.md** - Tax relationship stable (47k GP leverage added)

**Recommendation**: Update these in Arc 2 sync when their roles evolve.

## World-Building Files (Not Synced)

**Candidates for Future Sync**:
- **ARMI_System.md** - Could expand with new skills ([Market Arbitrage], [Precedent Defense])
- **Galactic_Exchange.md** - Needs comprehensive update (Tiers, Shell Companies, Arbitrage mechanics)
- **Church_of_Eternal_Light.md** - Miracle crisis, decline from 90% → 65% success rate

**Recommendation**: Create dedicated World sync after Arc 2 begins (batch updates more efficient).
