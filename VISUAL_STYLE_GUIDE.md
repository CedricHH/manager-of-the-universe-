# Visual Style Guide: The Manager of the Universe

> **Purpose**: Ensure consistent visual identity across all chapter covers and generated art.

## 1. Core Aesthetic: "Corporate Fantasy"

The visual signature is the **clash** between high-fantasy tropes and sterile corporate brutalism.

*   **Genre Blend**: Classic D&D High Fantasy vs. Modern Corporate Sci-Fi/Cyberpunk Lite.
*   **Atmosphere**: Cynical, polished, high-contrast.
*   **Lighting**:
    *   **Primary Source**: Warm, chaotic, natural light from the fantasy world (torches, sunlight, fireballs).
    *   **Secondary Source**: Cool, ordered, artificial blue/cyan light from Victor's ARMI interface.
    *   **Style**: Dramatic shadows (Chiaroscuro), "Cinematic" rendering.

## 3. Composition Rules

1.  **Juxtaposition**: Every image should ideally contain both a Fantasy element and a Corporate element.
2.  **Focus**: Center weighted or Rule of Thirds. Victor or the ARMI UI should usually be the focal point.
3.  **Palette**: High contrast.
    *   *Fantasy*: Earth tones, warm oranges, deep reds.
    *   *Corporate*: Cool blues, clean whites, dark greys.
