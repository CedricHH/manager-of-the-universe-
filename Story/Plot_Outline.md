## Victor's Skill Progression

As a "Restructurer," Victor doesn't learn fireballs. He unlocks **Management Modules** based on his economic influence.

| Arc | Tier | Key Skills Unlocked | Function |
|-----|------|---------------------|----------|
| **1** | **Manager** | `[Performance Review]`, `[Hostile Takeover]`, `[Contract Binding]` | Single-target control, analysis, debt creation |
| **2** | **Executive** | `[Market Manipulation]`, `[Asset Liquidation]`, `[Corporate Shield]` | Zone control, defense through wealth, mass contracts |
| **3** | **Chairman** | `[Nation State]`, `[Legislative Override]`, `[Sanction]` | Alter laws, paralyze economies, control armies |
| **4** | **Monopolist** | `[Global Embargo]`, `[Currency Control]`, `[Print Money]` | Reality warping through economics, infinite capital |
| **5** | **Auditor** | `[Universal Restructuring]`, `[Delete Asset]`, `[Rewrite Protocol]` | Admin access to reality itself |

## Victor's Awakening & Vision

### The Reincarnation Process (Prologue Moment)

Before Victor fully awakens in the dungeon, he exists briefly in a liminal space—the "Processing Queue" of the Galactic Audit Consortium.

In those seconds (which feel like hours), he glimpses:
- The universe is managed by the **Galactic Audit Consortium**
- They are **incompetent**—waste everywhere, inefficiencies in every system
- Gods hoard resources without optimization
- Reality itself has negative ROI
- Worlds are abandoned when "unprofitable"
- Terra-Insolvia is flagged for "Restructuring or Liquidation"

His hidden goal (not even he fully realizes yet): **Hostile takeover of existence itself.**

### Chapter 1 Structure

**IN MEDIA RES**: Victor wakes next to dead "Chosen Hero"
- Brief moment of confusion
- Begins to remember: The Consortium... the queue... he was *selected*
- ARMI System initializes, interrupting his thoughts
- **Cliffhanger**: Goblin pack approaches before he can process what happened

The full reincarnation memory returns in fragments during Arc 1.

## Backstory Integration (Complete in Arc 1)

Victor's past unfolds PRIMARILY in Arc 1 (Chapters 1-100):

### Flashback Structure

| Trigger | When | What Victor Remembers |
|---------|------|----------------------|
| **First quiet moment** | After goblin threat (Ch 3-4) | "I was... a manager. On Earth." |
| **Seeing Sniv's loyalty** | Ch 8-10 | The Betrayal (Board sacrificed him) |
| **Almost dying** | Ch 15-18 | The Aftermath (6 months of emptiness) |
| **Dungeon Core negotiation** | Ch 25-30 | The Discovery (conflict minerals, children died) |
| **Sterling's arrogance** | Ch 35-40 | The Decision (compile evidence) |
| **First real victory** | Ch 50-55 | The Selfless Act (server room, death) |
| **Leaving the dungeon** | Ch 75-85 | The "Worth It" moment |
| **Crisis in city transition** | Ch 90-100 | Full integration: Who he was, who he is now |

### After Arc 1

Backstory is **complete**, but Victor continues to draw **parallels**:
- "This kingdom's court reminds me of the board that betrayed me."
- "The Hero thinks he's righteous. So did I, once."
- "The Demon King negotiates like the Osaka executives."

These parallels enrich the narrative without new flashbacks.
