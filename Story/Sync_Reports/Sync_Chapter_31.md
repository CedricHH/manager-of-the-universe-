## Outline Comparison

### Chapter-Outline Match

| Planned (Outline) | Actually Written | Match |
|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Dashboard with upgrade options | ✓ Revenue Dashboard shown | ✓ |
| Victor allocates Trap Automation + Floor 3 Expansion | ✓ 70 GP spent on both | ✓ |
| Sniv raises morale concerns | ✓ Reports goblin exhaustion (Labor-9 crying) | ✓ |
| Victor implements rest days | ✓ Rotating 6-day schedule | ✓ |
| Floor 3 renovation completes in 48h | ✓ Completed in 47h 32m | ✓ |
| Zip finds ancient sealed passage | ✓ Discovered during mining | ✓ |
| Victor opens seal; ancient voice speaks | ✓ Exact match | ✓ |

**Verdict**: **100% outline adherence** — No deviations.

### Plot_Outline Match

Chapter 31 falls under:
- **Arc 1.2: Consolidation (Chapters 26-50)**
- **Chapters 26-35: New Management**

Planned beats:
- ✓ Core accepts partnership → Infrastructure upgrades begin
- ✓ First dungeon optimization 2.0

**Verdict**: Chapter aligns perfectly with Plot_Outline progression.

## New Information Introduced

### Infrastructure
- **Trap Automation System**: Auto-reset functionality saves 4 goblin-labor positions
- **Floor 3 Mining Expansion**: +200% extraction rate, produces iron ore, copper ore, and mana crystals
- **Estimated Monthly Revenue**: 68 GP from mining operations alone

### Employee Management
- **Rest Day Policy**: 1 day off per week per goblin, rotating 4-crew schedule
- **Productivity Impact**: ~14% theoretical loss, negligible with rotation
- **Morale Benefit**: Prevents burnout, increases loyalty

### Ancient Mystery
- **Sealed Chamber**: 800+ years old (predates dungeon by 500 years)
- **Location**: Deep beneath Floor 3, discovered during mining expansion
- **Magical Signature**: Non-standard, unrecognized by Nova
- **Contents**: Unknown entity with voice; appears intelligent and aware
- **Entity Quote**: *"Finally. I was beginning to think no one competent would ever find me."*

---

## Cascade Effects

### Immediate (Chapter 32+)
- ✓ **Ancient Entity Introduction**: Chapter 32 will need to reveal identity and nature of the voice
- ✓ **Resource Availability**: Mining operations provide iron/copper for equipment upgrades
- ✓ **Mana Crystals**: High-value loot for premium shop inventory

### Future Plot Implications
- **Ancient Chamber Arc**: Potential mid-Act 1 complication (as noted in Chapter-Outline notes)
- **Character Development**: Victor's morale policy shows subtle character growth ("efficiency that looks like kindness")
- **Mystery Hook**: Pre-dungeon structures suggest deeper world lore

**User Review Required**: NO — All changes align with established plans.
