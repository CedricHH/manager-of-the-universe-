# Sync Report: Chapter 06 - Departmental Structure

## Chapter Summary

Victor establishes formal organizational structure after waking to find goblins fighting. He implements:
- Org chart with chain of command
- Three departments: Food, Guard, Labor
- Candle-based time system for shifts
- Consequence framework (deprivation instead of violence)

The chapter ends with Victor deciding to expand to Floor 3 due to hostile goblins threatening food supply.
