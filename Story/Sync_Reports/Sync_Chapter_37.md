## World-Building

**Oakhaven Established**:
- Population: 12,000+
- Infrastructure: Paved roads, sewage, street lighting (enchanted crystals)
- Districts: Merchant quarter, old church district (Temple Street)
- Economy: Multiple guild halls, active markets, regional trade hub

**Consortium Waypoint**:
- Dormant for century+ but functional
- Automated recognition systems
- Transmits status reports to Administrative Network
- Pure efficiency aesthetic (no theatrical elements)

## Thematic Brilliance

**Earth Corporate Parallels**:
> "Instead of 'workforce reduction,' the terminology was 'population adjustment.' Instead of 'asset liquidation,' it said 'resource reclamation.'"

Connects Victor's past to Consortium methods = personal rebellion motivation.

**Economic Data Discovery**:
> "Terra-Insolvia's economy had *improved* during the fifteen centuries without Consortium management."

Future argumentlever: "You're not helping, you're extracting."
