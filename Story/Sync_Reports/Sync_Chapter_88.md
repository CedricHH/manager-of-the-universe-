## Cascade Effects

- [ ] **Barnaby**: Now a permanent traveling companion.
- [ ] **The Gilded Caravan**: Reduces travel time significantly (4 days vs 12). This accelerates the timeline for Arc 2 start.
- [ ] **Galactic Exchange**: New revenue stream identified. Victor will likely use this to hit the 1M goal.

## Summary

Chapter 88 resolves the cliffhanger from Ch 87 by turning the obstacle (Barnaby) into an asset. The acquisition of the Gilded Caravan solves the logistical problem of travel time, while the introduction of the Galactic Exchange provides the *mechanism* for Victor to achieve the "impossible" 1 Million Gold goal. The narrative is now pivoting from "local dungeon management" to "inter-dimensional arbitrage."
