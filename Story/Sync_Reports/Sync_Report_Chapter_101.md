## World/Lore Updates

### New Entities Introduced

- Guild Master: **Lysander Corvus** (38-year veteran)
- Revenue: 520,000 GP/year (15% transaction fees)
- Authority: City Guild Charter (municipal-level licensing monopoly)
- Vulnerability: Crown Territory exemption (Dungeon Commerce Act)

**Legal Mechanics**:
- **Crown Territory**: Dungeon entrances exempt from City Guild regulations
- **Dungeon Commerce Act**: Grants commercial jurisdiction to dungeon operators
- **Licensing loophole**: Victor can operate license-free at dungeon entrance

**Economic Data**:
- Market Quarter population: 45,000
- Weekly Guild fee collection: ~10,000 GP
- Potion market size: Standard pricing 50 silver, Victor's pricing 10 silver (80% undercut)

## Plot Threads Introduced

### 1. Merchant Guild Conflict (Primary)

- **Target**: Guild Master Lysander Corvus
- **Strategy**: 4-Phase Political War
  1. Silent Construction (Weeks 1-2)
  2. Launch (Week 3)
  3. Guild Response (Weeks 3-5) - expected legal/political pressure
  4. Political Escalation (Weeks 6-8) - mobilize adventurer constituency
- **Goal**: Force Guild licensing reform via public pressure (not direct confrontation)

### 2. Mystery Restructurer (Subplot)

- **Detection**: Restructurer-class mana signature in Market Quarter
- **Probability**: 68% second Consortium agent

- **Risk**: Competition for territory / Consortium evaluation?

## Continuity Notes

### Story Arc Differentiation ✅

| Aspect | Arc 1 (Mordecai Groll) | Arc 2 (Lysander Corvus) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Guild** | Alchemist Guild | **Merchant Guild** |
| **Conflict Type** | Hostile acquisition via debt | **Licensing bypass via Crown Territory** |
| **Victor's Advantage** | Lower production costs | **Legal exemption from Guild fees** |
| **Antagonist Style** | Defeated via foreclosure | **Bureaucratic/political resistance** |
| **Victory Method** | Absorbed guild into R&D Division | **Public pressure for regulatory reform** |

**NO PLOT REDUNDANCY** - Clean differentiation maintained.

---

## Deviations from Outline

**None significant**. The rewritten chapter follows the updated outline structure (Merchant Guild version). Minor expansions:
- Added more detail on Crown Territory legal mechanics
- Expanded Nova negotiation scene (2.5% vs original 3.5%)
- Deeper strategic explanation (political constituency building)

All deviations enhance clarity without changing plot direction.

## Next Chapter Dependencies

### Chapter 102 (The Recruitment)

**Must reflect**:
- Marcus is from Victor's **existing R&D Division** (not a defector from Merchant Guild)
- Construction is at **dungeon entrance** (Crown Territory)
- Lysander Corvus is the **new** antagonist (not Groll)
- Legal strategy is **licensing bypass**, not price war

**Status**: Outline already updated ✅ - ready for rewrite

### Chapter 104 (The Harvest)

**Must reflect**:
- Guild response will be **Inspector Greymark** (legal/bureaucratic), not Enforcer Kale (violent)
- Lysander's counter-strategy: **Crown pressure for territorial ruling**, not sabotage
- Conflict tone: **Bureaucratic warfare**, not physical threats

**Status**: Outline already updated ✅ - ready for rewrite

---
