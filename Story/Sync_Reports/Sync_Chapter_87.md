## Cascade Effects

- [ ] **Mina & Silas**: Now permanent assets. Will need periodic "Remote Management" scenes or reports in future chapters.
- [ ] **Barnaby**: New minor antagonist/obstacle introduced for Chapter 88.

## Summary

Chapter 87 successfully transitions Victor out of Aethelgard while solidifying his new "Consultant" status. The unexpected promotion of Mina and Silas converts two throwaway characters into a strategic asset (The Northern Branch), effectively " franchising" Victor's methodology. The cliffhanger (Barnaby) sets up the first immediate obstacle for the "Million Gold Month" timer.
