## Summary

**Chapter 34: Preparations** serves as a critical transition chapter, establishing:

1. **Organizational Independence**: Dungeon can operate without Victor (delegation structure tested)
2. **Character Depth**: Sniv's emotional evolution, Victor's internal conflict, Asterion's philosophical awareness
3. **Arc Transition**: Moving from "Dungeon Management" to "External World Exploration"
4. **Strategic Setup**: Merchant cover, Consortium infiltration, Oakhaven introduction

All character files updated with chapter developments. No plot contradictions detected. Chapter aligns perfectly with outline and advances story organically.

**Next Chapter Preview**: Chapter 35 will likely cover:
- Victor and Zip's travel to Oakhaven
- First external world encounters
- Sniv managing dungeon (parallel storyline?)
- Potential Iron Wolves return event
