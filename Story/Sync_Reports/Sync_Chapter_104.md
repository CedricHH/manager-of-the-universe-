| Arc 2.1 - Potion Revolution | Noted Groll/Kale introduction | ✓ To update |
| Future chapters | No cascade effects detected | ✓ No changes needed |

**Updated Text** (to be applied):
```markdown
- **Chapter 104 - The Harvest**: [WRITTEN] First slime farm harvest (2,014 cores, 101% yield). 
  Victor accelerates timeline: opens apothecary immediately (vs. 2-week plan). Marcus produces 
  2,000 potions overnight. Professional letter sent to Groll (controlled first contact). 
  **Day 1 Launch**: Sold out in 5h23m, 200 GP revenue, 847 customers, 18% market penetration. 
  **Guild Master Groll introduced**: 42-year veteran, competent antagonist. Assembles Council, 
  sends Enforcer Kale for intelligence gathering. Guild retaliation imminent (24-48 hours).
```

---

## Cascade Effects

### Impact on Future Chapters:

- [x] **Chapter 105**: Must address Guild retaliation (Kale's intel → Groll's response)
- [x] **Chapter 106+**: Price war escalates, possible Guild sabotage/violence
- [ ] **Marcus Thiel subplot**: Eventually discovered by Guild (already timeline-noted)
- [ ] **Slime farm security**: Guild may target production facility

### Requires User Review: **NO**

All changes are logical progressions. Guild War arc escalating as planned.

---

## Economic Status Update

**Victor's Finances (Ch 104)**:
- **Starting**: ~975,000 GP
- **Day 1 Revenue**: +200 GP (20,000 silver)
- **Operating Costs**: Minimal (slime farm automated, goblins unpaid, guards on retainer)
- **Net Position**: ~975,200 GP

**Market Impact**:
- Guild revenue loss: ~800 GP (customers who would have paid 50 silver, paid Victor 10 silver)
- Market penetration: 18% (Day 1)
- Projected weekly revenue: ~196 GP (at 285 potions/day sustained rate)

**Guild War Economics**:
- Victor's production cost: 3 silver/potion
- Victor's price: 10 silver/potion → 233% margin
- Guild production cost: 8 silver/potion
- Guild price: 50 silver/potion → 525% margin
- **Victor's advantage**: Lower cost + willing to accept lower margin = sustainable price war

---

## Timeline Tracking

**In-Story Timeline** (from Victor's perspective):
- **Day 0** (Ch 103): Met Kira, received BROKEN CROWN offer (14-day deadline)
- **Day 1** (Ch 104): Slime harvest, apothecary launch
- **Day 2** (Ch 105 likely): Groll retaliation begins
- **Day 14**: BROKEN CROWN decision deadline
- **3-Day Window**: Groll discovers Marcus defection (originally predicted, now accelerated by Victor's launch)

**Concurrent Pressures**:
- Guild War: ACTIVE (retaliation imminent)
- BROKEN CROWN decision: 13 days remaining
- Slime farm: Weekly harvest cycle established
