## Hook (200-300 words)

8:00 AM.

92 spectators arrive for today's tournament.

Empty registration board.

Confusion. Then anger.

"Where are the parties?"

"We paid in advance!"

"This is a scam!"

Victor appears on the viewing room projection screen.

"Ladies and gentlemen. Due to circumstances beyond our control, all registered parties have withdrawn."

Crowd erupts in outrage.

Victor continues, calm.

"However. The show will go on. Today, you'll witness something unprecedented:"

**"The Dungeon's Own Employees Will Fight Ignatia."**

Silence.

Then: "...What?"

## Development

### Beat 1: The Employee Roster (300-400 words)

**Scene**: Viewing room projection - Victor presents the teams

**Team 1: "Management"**
- Asterion (Tank - Minotaur, Level 22)
- Valerius (Support/Strategist - Vampire, Level 19)  
- Zip (Utility/Healer - Kobold, Level 14)

**Team 2: "Operations"**
- Gorg (DPS - Troll, Level 18)
- Sniv (Rogue/Scout - Goblin, Level 16)
- Roland (Paladin - Level 20, "guest employee")

**Team 3: "The Boss Fight" (Finale)**
- Victor himself will challenge Ignatia
- Solo run
- Stakes: If he wins, spectators get refunds + free next tournament entry
- If he loses... "I'll reconsider my management strategy."

**Crowd Reaction**:
- Skeptical: "Monsters fighting a dragon? That's rigged."
- Curious: "I want to see the Minotaur vs Dragon."
- Gambling starts immediately

**ARMI Projection**:
```
> **[ARMI]**
> Employee Exhibition - Risk Analysis
> Team 1 Win Probability: 34% (Asterion strong, but Zip undertrained)
> Team 2 Win Probability: 28% (Gorg powerful but reckless)
> Victor Solo Win Probability: 11% (skill gap significant)
> Reputation Gain (If Successful): +80% brand loyalty
> Reputation Loss (If All Fail): -40% trust
```

### Beat 2: Team 1 - "Management" (400-500 words)

**The Fight**:
- Asterion charges Phase 1, tanking **Flame Torrent** with pure Constitution
- Valerius provides blood magic buffs (AT boost, regeneration)
- Zip panics initially, but Valerius coaches him through heal rotations

**Phase 2**:
- Ignatia goes aerial
- Asterion can't reach her
- **Problem**: No ranged DPS
- **Solution**: Valerius uses blood whips to ground her (creative use of vampire powers)

**Phase 3**:
- Ultimate **Inferno Burst**
- Asterion: "ZIP! BARRIER!"
- Zip casts his first-ever Tier-2 barrier spell (shaky, but holds)
- They survive with 12% HP combined

**Final Push**:
- Asterion grapples Ignatia's wings
- Valerius blood-drains to weaken her
- Zip throws a rock (it misses, but distracts her)
- **Victory at 31 minutes, 14 seconds**

**Crowd Reaction**:
- Stunned silence
- Then: Standing ovation
- "THE MINOTAUR GRAPPLED A DRAGON!"
- "Zip is my new favorite!"

### Beat 3: Team 2 - "Operations" (350-450 words)

**The Fight**:
- Gorg charges recklessly, takes massive damage Phase 1
- Sniv uses guerrilla tactics (poison, traps, hit-and-run)
- Roland conflicted: He's Church, but he's also... enjoying this

**Phase 2**:
- Ignatia targets Gorg (he's loudest)
- Gorg: "COME AT ME, LIZARD!"
- **Meteor Dive** - Gorg tanks it, barely survives
- Sniv: "Boss! You're supposed to DODGE!"
- Gorg: "DODGING IS FOR COWARDS!"

**Phase 3**:
- Gorg goes berserk (Troll racial ability)
- Damage output doubles, but defense drops
- Roland uses **Divine Intervention** to save Gorg from Inferno Burst
- Sniv lands killing blow with poisoned dagger to dragon's eye

**Victory at 28 minutes, 6 seconds** (Faster than Team 1!)

**Post-Match**:
- Roland approaches Victor: "I... enjoyed that."
- Victor: "You're welcome to participate in future tournaments. As a competitor, not a compliance officer."
- Roland (conflicted): "I'll... consider it."

**Crowd**: "OPERATIONS BEAT MANAGEMENT!"

### Beat 4: Victor's Solo Run (400-500 words)

**Scene**: Victor enters the arena alone
- No armor
- No weapon
- Just ARMI interface and Asset Manager abilities

**The Fight**:

**Phase 1**:
- Victor uses **[Efficiency Optimization]** skill (buffs movement speed, reduces dragon attack speed)
- Dodges **Flame Torrent** with calculated movement (ARMI predicts attack patterns)
- No damage dealt yet—pure evasion

**Phase 2**:
- Ignatia goes aerial
- Victor: "ARMI, activate [Resource Reallocation]."
\u003e **[ARMI - SKILL ACTIVATED]**
\u003e Resource Reallocation: Redirect dungeon mana to user
\u003e Effect: Temporary mana shield + elemental resistance
\u003e Duration: 90 seconds
\u003e Cost: 500 MP

- Victor tanks **Meteor Dive** with mana shield
- Crowd gasps: "How is he still standing?!"

**Phase 3**:
- Ultimate **Inferno Burst** incoming
- Victor doesn't dodge
- He activates **[Hostile Acquisition]** (signature move from Ch 42)
- Redirects 40% of Ignatia's ultimate damage BACK to her
- Dragon damages herself

**Final Moment**:
- Ignatia at 23% HP
- Victor at 8% HP
- Victor: "ARMI. Activate [Termination Protocol]."
- ARMI: **"Confirmed. Ending employment contract."**
- Ignatia's HP drops to 0% instantly

**Crowd Confusion**: "WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!"

**Victor (via projection)**: "Ignatia is my employee. I have the authority to terminate her contract mid-combat. She's rehired effective immediately."

**Ignatia** (reappears, laughing): "**YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD. THAT WAS BRILLIANT.**"

**Victory at 19 minutes, 2 seconds** (New record!)

**Crowd**: Loses. Their. Minds.

## Cliffhanger & Arc Resolution (200-250 words)

Post-matches. Evening.

The guilds arrive—all three Guildmasters.

They expected failure.

They saw: Three victories. Employee dominance. Victor's impossible solo win.

Groll: "This changes nothing."

Victor: "It changes everything. You tried to destroy my brand. I turned it into the greatest show Oakhaven's ever seen."

Kael: "You got lucky."

Victor: "I optimized. There's a difference."

Voros (smiling): "Franchise pilot approved. Rivercrest launches in three weeks."

Guild cartel: Broken.

**Final Statistics**:
\u003e **[ARMI - AFTERMATH REPORT]**
\u003e Spectators: 92 (100% satisfaction rating)
\u003e Employee Victories: 3/3 (100% success rate)
\u003e Revenue: 4,600 GP (spectator refunds waived - Victor's promise void after victory)
\u003e Brand Loyalty: +95% (cultural phenomenon status CEMENTED)
\u003e Guild Threat Level: NEUTRALIZED
\u003e Franchise Expansion: APPROVED

**Final Line**: 

Victor watches the projection of his solo victory replay.

The Consortium's voice echoes in his memory: *"You were reassigned."*

He'd died once for principle.

Now he was winning for profit.

Somehow, that felt right.

**Arc Complete: Church Audit & Tournament Growth (Ch 72-75)**

***

**STATUS**: Employee exhibition matches executed flawlessly. Team Management won (31:14), Team Operations won (28:06), Victor solo won via [Termination Protocol] exploit (19:02 - new record). Guild cartel broken. Brand loyalty at 95%. Franchise expansion approved (Rivercrest pilot). Arc complete. Church neutralized, tournaments cultural phenomenon, Victor's strategic dominance absolute.
