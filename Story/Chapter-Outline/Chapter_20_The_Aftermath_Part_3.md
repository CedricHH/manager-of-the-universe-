## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Reinforced Party

The Silver Lance + 2 new fighters:
- **Gareth** (Tank, Lv 12)
- **Lysa** (Healer, Lv 10)
- **Finn** (Rogue, Lv 11)
- **Mira** (Mage, Lv 13)
- **NEW: Bron** (Berserker, Lv 14)
- **NEW: Sister Alara** (Paladin, Lv 15)

They're serious this time.
> Alara: "The boss monster roared. This is a real dungeon."
> Gareth: "We clear it. Split the loot. Make names."

### Beat 2: Victor's Observation

Victor watches from the shadows (Scrying via ARMI).
> "They brought a healer AND a paladin. They're expecting casualties."

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Modified Traps

The party enters.
- **Mud pit** (Previously spikes): Finn falls in. Stuck, not dead.
- **Swinging log** (Previously blade): Bron gets knocked back. Winded, not sliced.

They're surprised.
> Mira: "These traps... they're not lethal?"
> Gareth: "Stay cautious. Could be a trick."

### Beat 4: The Gauntlet

Victor's goblins harass them.
- Rock-throwing from shadows
- Fake retreats to draw them into dead ends
- Smoke bombs (New invention!)

The party takes cuts, bruises—no deaths.
They reach Floor 3.

### Beat 5: FLASHBACK - The Server Room (Final)

**Setting**: Abandoned server farm. Night. Rain.

Victor meets the reporter.
He hands over the USB.
> "This is everything. The emails. The money. The video."

The reporter nods.
> "This will destroy them."
> "You know they'll come for you?"
> Victor: "I know."

He walks outside.
A black SUV is waiting.
Men in suits.
They don't arrest him.
They just... shoot.

**Victor dies.**

### Beat 6: The Transition

Darkness.
Then... light.
A voice (The Galactic Audit Consortium?):
> "SOUL DETECTED. DESIGNATION: OPTIMAL RESTRUCTURER."
> "DEPLOYING TO PRIORITY SECTOR: TERRA-INSOLVIA."

Victor wakes up next to Marcus's corpse.
**The loop closes.**

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: Back to the Present

Victor opens his eyes.
He's still in the dungeon. Still watching the Silver Lance.
The memory is complete now.
He knows who he was. What he did. How he died.

### Beat 8: The Choice

The Silver Lance reaches the stairs to Floor 4.
They're going to fight Asterion.
If they die, Victor fulfills the contract (Worthy opponent delivered).
If they win... Victor loses his protection.

Victor has to choose:
- Let them fight (Risk losing Asterion)
- Intervene (Reveal himself)

He steps out of the shadows.
> "Ladies and gentlemen. I believe there's been a scheduling error."
