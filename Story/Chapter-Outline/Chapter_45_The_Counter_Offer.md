# Outline: Chapter 45 - The Counter-Offer

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2000

## Hook
The immediate collision of Victor's **[Hostile Takeover]** skill against the Alchemist Guild's magical signal. The visual representation of "Corporate Logic" vs "Brute Force Mana". The dungeon walls stop vibrating, but the air pressure drops as the two wills collide.

## Development

### Beat 1: The Digital Trace
Victor navigates the connection like a network admin. To the others (Mira, Kael), he's standing still, eyes glowing. To Victor, he is analyzing the data packets of mana.
- He identifies the "Admin Access" request from the Guild.
- He sees the crudeness of their code (inefficient mana loops, memory leaks).
- He decides not just to block, but to *dominate*. "You opened a door to my house? Now I'm walking into yours."

### Beat 2: The Logic Bomb
Victor rides the signal back to the source (the Mana Spikes outside, relaying to a crystal in the Guild HQ).
- He visualizes the mages at the other end.
- He crafts a payload: Not a fireball, but a Bureaucratic Overload.
- **Skill Usage**: `[Contract Binding]` + `[Hostile Takeover]`. He forces the opposing mana to "sign" conflicting agreements, causing a logic loop.
- "Error 404: Mana Not Found."

### Beat 3: The System Crash
The feedback loop hits the Guild.
- Outside, the Mana Spikes shatter / burn out.
- Inside the dungeon, the pressure releases instantly.
- Nova reboots, traumatized but safe. "Admin privileges restored."
- Victor slumps, exhausted. MP drained.

## Cliffhanger
The immediate threat is gone, but the silence is heavy. Victor realized something during the connection. Groll wasn't just guessing; he had *blueprints* of a Core's frequency. Someone sold the dungeon out from the inside—or Groll has backing from a much higher power (Arc 4 foreshadowing?).
But before they can rest, Sniv points to the entrance. "Boss... the spikes are broken... but the scouts are still watching."

## Checklist
- [ ] Victor demonstrates "Corporate Magic" superiority
- [ ] Nova's vulnerability shown
- [ ] The "Hack" explained in business terms
- [ ] Lead-in to the Guild Pressure arc
