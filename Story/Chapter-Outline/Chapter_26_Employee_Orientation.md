## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Morning After

Victor stands in the Core Chamber.
The dungeon is **his** now.

But ownership means responsibility.

**ARMI Alert**:
> Warning: Organizational Structure Unstable
> - 26 Employees (Goblins, Kobold)
> - 1 Allied Entity (Asterion) - Not Contracted
> - 1 Infrastructure (Dungeon Core) - Passive Mode
> Recommendation: Formalize command hierarchy.

### Beat 2: The Problem

Asterion isn't an employee yet.
He's an "allied entity" - a temporary alliance, not a binding contract.

If Victor wants the Minotaur's loyalty guaranteed, he needs paperwork.

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The HR Meeting

Victor summons Asterion to the Core Chamber.

Asterion arrives, massive, uncertain.
> "You summoned me... Manager."

Victor holds up a document.
> "Your current status is 'allied entity.' That's... unstable. I'm offering you a permanent position."

### Beat 4: The Contract Terms

Victor presents the employment contract:

**POSITION**: Chief Security Officer (CSO)
**COMPENSATION**:
- Base salary: 10 GP/week
- Dental coverage (new)
- Vision coverage (reading glasses provided)
- Respawn guarantee (Victor pays premium if Asterion dies)

**DUTIES**:
- Defend dungeon from hostile incursions
- Train security personnel
- Maintain "optimal fear levels" for revenue

**CLAUSES**:
- Non-compete (cannot work for rival dungeons)
- Performance reviews (quarterly)
- Dress code (formal vest required)

### Beat 5: Asterion's Reaction

Asterion reads the contract slowly.
His massive hands tremble slightly.

> "In 247 years... no one has ever offered me compensation."

Victor: "That was poor management. I don't repeat others' mistakes."

Asterion looks at the dental line.
> "What is... 'dental'?"

Victor: "Tooth maintenance. Your tusks looked chipped. That affects productivity."

### Beat 6: The Signing

Asterion signs.
The contract glows briefly, binding.

**[Contract Binding] Active**
> Asterion - Chief Security Officer
> Loyalty: Contractual (Unbreakable while terms honored)

Victor: "Welcome to the team. Your first task: Report for orientation."

Asterion: "Orientation?"

Victor: "You'll need to learn the updated organizational structure."

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Org Chart

Victor presents his new organizational structure to the assembled staff:

```
VICTOR KAINE (CEO / Administrator)
    ↓
DUNGEON CORE-7749 (Infrastructure)
    ↓
├── ASTERION (CSO) - Security Division
│   └── Krog (Guard Team Lead)
│       └── [5 Guard Goblins]
│
├── SNIV (COO) - Operations Division
│   └── [15 Worker Goblins]
│
└── ZIP (CTO) - R&D Division
    └── [Kobold Workshop - Solo]
```

The goblins stare, confused.
Sniv beams with pride.
Asterion studies the chart like a philosophical text.

### Beat 8: The Future

Victor: "This is Phase 1. Phase 2 begins tomorrow."

Sniv: "What Phase 2, Boss?"

Victor looks at the dormant Dungeon Core.
> "The Core is in passive mode. It processes mana, but it doesn't think. Doesn't optimize. It's running on legacy systems."

He turns to face them.
> "I'm going to wake it up. And then we're going to have a conversation about... synergy."

**ARMI Alert**:
> Dungeon Core-7749: Communication Protocol Available
> Warning: Core Intelligence unpredictable after 50+ years dormancy
> Recommendation: Proceed with caution.

Victor ignores the warning.
He's never been cautious when opportunity presented itself.

## Checklist

- [x] **Milestone**: Asterion formally employed
- [x] **System**: Contract Binding used, org chart established
- [x] **Character Development**: Asterion's first experience of being valued
- [x] **Foreshadowing**: Next chapter will wake the Core

---

## Notes for Writing

- **Tone**: Professional but absurdist. Corporate process applied to fantasy monsters.
- **Asterion**: His vulnerability when seeing the contract is key. 247 years of nothing, now dental.
- **The Org Chart**: Comedy gold. Goblins don't understand hierarchy but accept it.
- **Core Awakening**: Setup for Ch 27.

---

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
**Next Chapter**: Chapter 27 - The Core Awakening
