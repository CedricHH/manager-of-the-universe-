# Outline: Chapter 46 - Due Diligence

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2000

## Hook
The morning after the Alchemist attack. The forest is quiet. The Merchant Guild scouts are still there, simply *watching*.
- **Visual**: They aren't hiding. They have set up a desk at the edge of the clearing. A literal desk.
- **Action**: Kael wants to attack. Victor stops him. "You don't shoot the auditor. That admits guilt."

## Development

### Beat 1: The Inspection
Victor walks out to meet them. Wearing his best suit (cleaned by slime-enzymes).
- **The Scout Leader**: **Valerius**. Not a warrior. A scribe. Level 12 "Appraiser".
- **Interaction**: Valerius notes the destroyed mana spikes. "Property damage?" Victor: "Garbage disposal."
- **The Move**: Victor invites them inside. "Full transparency. We have nothing to hide from lawful commerce."

### Beat 2: The Tour
Victor gives a guided tour of the dungeon *as a business*.
- Shows the "Employee Break Room" (Goblins eating soup).
- Shows the "Security Infrastructure" (Asterion polishing his axe/Asset Protection).
- Shows the "Revenue Stream" (The shop).
- **Satire**: Victor speaks entirely in corporate buzzwords. Valerius nods, writing furiously. They speak the same language. Kael and Mira are baffled.

### Beat 3: The Findings
They return to the surface. Valerius finishes his report.
- "Operational standards: Exceeds expectations."
- "Hygiene: Adequate."
- "Staff morale: Surprisingly high."

## Cliffhanger
Valerius stamps the document.
"However," he says, adjusting his monocle. "There is the matter of the zoning permit."
- The land is technically zoned for "Wilderness/Monster Habitat." Running a retail enterprise here is a violation of Royal Decree 774.
- **The Threat**: Not a sword, but a fine. A massive one. Daily. Retroactive.
- "We can rush a rezoning application," Valerius offers with a smile. "But it requires a sponsor. A Guild partner."
- Elena Cross doesn't want to destroy him. She wants to *own* him.

## Checklist
- [ ] Victor vs Bureaucracy (Round 2)
- [ ] Humorous tour of the dungeon
- [ ] Logic-battle with Valerius
- [ ] Cliffhanger establishes the "Golden Handcuffs" threat
- [ ] ARMI tracks the "Social Credit" score with the Guild
