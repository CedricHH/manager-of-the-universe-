## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Dashboard

Victor opens his new **Revenue Dashboard**:

> **INSOLVIA HOLDINGS - WEEKLY REPORT**
> - Cash Reserves: 110 GP
> - Employee Count: 28 (26 goblins, 1 kobold, 1 minotaur)
> - Infrastructure: 5 Floors (3 Active, 2 Under-Utilized)
> - Customer Retention: 100% (1 party, 1 return visit pending)

Nova: "CAPITAL RESERVES SUFFICIENT FOR EXPANSION. RECOMMENDATIONS AVAILABLE."

### Beat 2: The Options

Nova presents upgrade options:

| Upgrade | Cost | Benefit |
|---------|------|---------|
| Trap Automation | 30 GP | Traps reset automatically |
| Monster Spawner (Basic) | 50 GP | Spawn Tier 1 monsters |
| Floor 3 Renovation | 40 GP | Expand mining operations |
| Defensive Perimeter | 25 GP | Early warning system |

Victor: "We're a business, not a fortress. Prioritize revenue over defense."

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Investments

Victor allocates:

1. **Trap Automation** (30 GP) - Reduces labor costs
2. **Floor 3 Renovation** (40 GP) - Mining = raw materials = revenue

Remaining: 40 GP reserve.

Nova: "FLOOR 3 RENOVATION REQUIRES 48 HOURS. ASSIGN WORKFORCE?"

Victor: "Sniv, you're Project Manager. Krog handles security during construction. Zip designs the extraction system."

### Beat 4: The Labor Question

Sniv raises concern:

> "Boss... goblins tired. Work hard every day. Some... grumble."

Victor pauses.

Employee morale. He'd forgotten that variable.

Victor: "What do they want?"

Sniv: "...Day off? Maybe? Once per week?"

### Beat 5: The Policy

Victor calculates:
- 26 goblins, 7 days work
- 1 day off = 14% productivity loss
- BUT: Morale crash = higher turnover, training costs

> "Implement rotating rest schedule. 4 crews, 6-day rotation. Everyone gets one day off per week. Productivity impact: minimal. Morale impact: optimal."

Sniv stares: "Boss... give goblins... vacation?"

Victor: "I'm giving them *scheduled maintenance*. Machines break if you run them constantly. So do employees."

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 6: The Construction

48 hours later.

Floor 3 gleams. New mining tunnels. Ore carts. A proper extraction operation.

**ARMI Update**:
> Floor 3 Renovation Complete
> - Mining Capacity: +200%
> - New Resource: Iron Ore (sellable)
> - New Resource: Mana Crystals (rare, high value)

### Beat 7: The Discovery

Zip approaches, excited:

> "Boss-Boss! Found something! Deep tunnel! Not on map!"

Victor: "Show me."

They descend to Floor 3's new section.

A hidden passage. Ancient. Sealed with old magic.

Nova's voice: "WARNING. UNKNOWN STRUCTURE DETECTED. PRE-DATING THIS DUNGEON'S CREATION. RECOMMEND CAUTION."

Victor examines the seal.

> "This dungeon is 312 years old. What's behind a door that's *older* than the dungeon itself?"

He reaches for the seal.

The stone glows.

## Checklist

- [x] **Milestone**: Infrastructure upgrades implemented

- [x] **Discovery**: Ancient sealed passage found
- [x] **Cliffhanger**: What predates the dungeon?

## Notes for Writing

- **Dashboard Scenes**: Keep them brief. Numbers should feel natural, not info-dump.
- **The Rest Day Decision**: Shows Victor's evolution. He's not kind—he's efficient. But efficiency sometimes looks like kindness.
- **The Sealed Door**: Mystery hook. Could lead to Arc 1's mid-point complication.
- **Zip**: Gets more spotlight. Kobold engineer finding ancient mysteries = fun.

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
**Next Chapter**: Chapter 32 - The Vault (What's behind the ancient door?)
