> **Status**: ✅ WRITTEN (2026-01-04) | Word Count: 1,700

## Continuity Notes (From Chapter 47)
- Sir Gareth of House Sterling arrived with 6-person party
- He initially refused to pay, drew sword on Victor
- Asterion forced him to his knees
- ARMI displayed: "Whale Detected. Harpoon Prepared."
- Gareth was reaching for his coin purse

## Characters
- **Victor**: The CEO. Sees nobility as premium customers, not threats.
- **Sir Gareth of House Sterling**: Arrogant noble, cousin to Lord Reginald. Humiliated but paying.
- **Asterion**: Head of Security. Enforcing policy with bovine patience.
- **Sniv**: Customer Service. Learning to upsell the wealthy.
- **Valerius**: The Consultant. Nervous about Sterling connections.
- **Gareth's Party**: 5 noble companions (nameless fodder with expensive equipment).

## Plot Beats

### 1. The Hook (200-300 words)
- Gareth pays the ten gold, seething with rage
- Victor doesn't gloat — he upgrades the experience
- "For your... inconvenience, I'm upgrading you to the Platinum Package. Complimentary."
- Gareth is confused. Is this an apology? (It's not. It's a trap.)

### 2. The Platinum Package (300-400 words)
- Victor personally escorts the party to the dungeon entrance
- Explains the "benefits": Personal guide (Sniv), Priority Resurrections (doesn't exist), VIP Loot Table access
- The real purpose: Keep them in the dungeon longer, learn about House Sterling
- ARMI: **[Skill Active: Social Engineering]**

### 3. The Intelligence Gathering (400-500 words)
- While Gareth's party descends, Victor pumps Valerius for Sterling intel
- Learns: Gareth is Lord Reginald's nephew, here to "prove himself"
- Lord Reginald sent him to retrieve something from the dungeon — possibly the Core
- Victor realizes: Sterling knows about Nova (Core-7749)
- This is a reconnaissance-in-force, not just adventuring
- ARMI calculates: This is an opportunity, not a threat

### 4. The Dungeon Experience (300-400 words)
- Cut to Gareth's party struggling on Floor 2
- They're skilled but arrogant — taking unnecessary risks
- Sniv leads them into "premium encounters" (harder than advertised)
- One of them gets injured; they have to use their expensive healing items
- Gareth curses the dungeon, the "commoner" Victor, everything
- But he's committed. He can't leave empty-handed.

### 5. The Cliffhanger (200-300 words)
- Gareth's party reaches the Core Chamber (Floor 3)
- They expect a prize. They find... a conference room
- Nova (the Core) is there. In the form of a glowing orb on a pedestal
- But she's not alone
- Victor is already there, sitting at the table with tea
- "Sir Gareth. I've been expecting you. Please, sit. Let's discuss... terms."
- ARMI: **[Negotiation Mode: Hostile Acquisition Detected]**

## Key Dialogues
- Victor: "The Platinum Package includes personalized service. Consider this... concierge treatment."
- Gareth: "When my uncle hears of this—"
- Victor: "I'm counting on it."
- Valerius (panicking): "You're baiting House Sterling deliberately?!"
- Victor: "I'm not baiting. I'm marketing. To decision-makers."

## ARMI Updates
- **[Transaction Complete]**: 10 Gold Received. Whale Harpooned.
- **[Intelligence Acquired]**: House Sterling - Reconnaissance Confirmed.
- **[Negotiation Mode]**: Hostile Acquisition Detected.

## Themes
- The rich aren't enemies — they're customers with deeper pockets
- Information is more valuable than gold
- Victor is playing a longer game than anyone realizes

## Style Notes
- Mobile-optimized paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Victor's corporate vocabulary contrasts with fantasy setting
- Gareth's arrogance should make readers want to see him humiliated
- End on tension: Victor is ahead, but we don't know his plan yet

## Written vs Planned

| Planned | Actually Written |
|---------|------------------|
| Gareth is "cousin" to Lord Reginald | Gareth is **nephew** of Lord Reginald |
| Dungeon experience scene (300-400 words) | Condensed to ~150 words (summary list format) |
| Victor escorts party himself | Sniv guides party; Victor waits in Core Chamber |

**Reason for deviations**: 
- Nephew creates clearer generational dynamic (heir vs peer)
- Summary format improved pacing; detailed struggle less important than payoff
- Victor waiting in Chamber creates stronger "chess master" impression

**Impact**: Minor. No plot cascades. Synced to Sir_Gareth_Sterling.md character profile.
