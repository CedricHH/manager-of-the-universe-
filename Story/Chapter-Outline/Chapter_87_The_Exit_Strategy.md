# Outline: Chapter 87 - The Exit Strategy [WRITTEN]

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000

## Hook
- **Setting**: The private carriage, moving south from the Spire Gardens.
- **Action**: Victor reviews the [Liquidation Report] from the mine explosion.
- **Conflict**: He notices a "Bureaucratic Hold" on 15% of his funds. Thaddeus Vane is attempting a post-transaction "Processing Fee" (hidden tax).
- **Goal**: Victor acts to secure his capital before he crosses the border.

## Development
### Beat 1: The Remote Management
- Victor attempts to fix it, but he is "out of jurisdiction" physically.
- He activates the [Remote Employment] protocol.
- He calls Mina and Silas (still back at the Aethelgard office) via a crystalline communication device (or ARMI link).
- **Dialogue**: He informs them they are no longer "Temporary Hires." They are now "The Aethelgard Branch."

### Beat 2: The Proxy War
- **Cut to**: Mina and Silas at the office. Bureau agents (sent by Vane) are trying to seize Victor's files/assets as "State Evidence."
- Mina uses her "Pedantry" trait to stall them. She cites Regulation 894-C (Evidence vs. Proprietary Data).
- Silas uses his "Pessimism" to point out the catastrophic liability risks if the Bureau mismanages the "Volatile Gold Residue" in the files.
- They channel Victor's "Corporate Horror" style, intimidating the agents not with magic, but with paperwork and threat of audit.

### Beat 3: The Liquidation of Authority
- Victor guides them remotely. "Don't fight them. Bill them."
- Mina issues an "Administrative Injunction" blocking Vane's fee until a "Compliance Review" is complete.
- Vane (off-screen or via proxy) realizes the cost of fighting the injunction exceeds the fee. He drops the claim.
- **Victory**: The 15% hold is released. Victor gets his gold.

## Cliffhanger
- Victor signs off with Mina/Silas: "Keep the office. I'll need a northern headquarters when I buy the planet."
- The carriage stops abruptly at the city gates/border.
- **Threat**: It isn't the Bureau. It's something else. A blockade? Or perhaps the first "obstacle" of the 1 Million Gold Month.
- **Ending Line**: "Driver, if that's a toll booth, run it over. If it's an army, charge them for the obstruction."

## Checklist
- [x] Victor demonstrates competence (Remote delegation, legal warfare)
- [x] Mina/Silas character growth (Using Victor's methods)
- [x] ARMI system messages (Transaction updates)
- [x] Cliffhanger (The journey home begins with a bump)
