## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Time Skip

One week passes.
The dungeon is transforming.

**Changes**:
- Floor 1: Cleaned, trapped properly (Non-lethal → filter weak adventurers)
- Floor 2: Slime farming + Mushroom agriculture
- Floor 3: Mining expanded (Iron, some copper)
- Floor 4: Asterion's domain (Do not disturb)
- Floor 5: Victor's HQ

### Beat 2: Zip's Workshop

Zip has a corner of Floor 3.
He's building:
- Tripwires (Simple but effective)
- Smoke bombs (Mushroom spores + fire)
- A crossbow prototype (Crude, breaks after 3 shots)

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Economy

Victor analyzes his resources:
- **Income**: ~20 GP/week (From adventurer drops + rat pelts traded via dead drops)
- **Expenses**: ~15 GP/week (Food, Materials)
- **Net**: +5 GP/week

It's... sustainable. But not profitable.

### Beat 4: Sniv's Report

> "Boss. Sniv hear news from outside."
> "Silver Lance people talk in town."
> "'Dungeon has boss monster.' 'Manager human.' 'Dangerous.'"

The marketing worked.
More adventurers will come.

### Beat 5: The Roster Review

Victor checks his team:
- **Sniv** (Hobgoblin in progress): Evolution at 40%. Needs XP.
- **Krog** (Goblin Lead, Guard Team): Strong, loyal, dumb.
- **Zip** (Kobold Engineer): Clever, fragile, needs protection.
- **Asterion**: Allied but not controlled.

### Beat 6: The Missing Piece

Victor needs **information infrastructure**.
Spies. Networks. Eyes outside.
He can't keep sending Sniv alone.

He assigns 3 goblins to "Recon Training":
- Learn human roads
- Observe without being seen
- Report weekly

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Dungeon Core

While exploring Floor 3's depths, the miners find something.
A door. Old. Sealed with runes.
Behind it: **A glow**.

Victor opens it.
A chamber. Small. Clean.
In the center: A floating crystal.
**The Dungeon Core.**

### Beat 8: First Contact

The crystal pulses.
**ARMI Interface**:
> External Entity Detected.
> Classification: Dungeon Core (Designation: 7749)
> Status: Dormant (Low Mana)
> Action: Awaiting Administrator Input.

The dungeon has a brain.
And it's been waiting for someone to wake it up.
