# Chapter 86: The Black Envelope

## 1. Chapter Goal
Victor opens the recruitment offer from the Galactic Audit Consortium. He realizes this is his ticket to the "Macro" game (Arc 5 endgame), but the entry fee is steep. He must negotiate his own hiring terms with a cosmic bureaucracy.

## 2. The Hook
**Focus**: The immediate aftermath of the explosion/liquidation.
**Action**: The dust is settling. Malphas is being dragged away by Imperial guards. Victor is ignored because he's holding the Black Envelope. It pulses with a frequency only he (and ARMI) can feel.
**Internal Monologue**: The gold yield (+45k) was good. The envelope is better.

## 3. Story Beats
1. **The Cleanup (Brief)**:
   - Thaddeus Vane arrives. He's furious about the explosion but silenced by the profit report (45k yield + Malphas arrested).
   - Victor hands over the physical territory (the mine crater) to the Empire. He keeps the liquid assets.
   - Hestia watches. She knows what's in the envelope. She's not smiling anymore; she's *evaluating*.

2. **The Unsealing**:
   - Victor retreats to his temporary office.
   - He opens the Black Envelope.
   - It's not paper. It's a localized localized reality rift—a "Void Ledger."
   - **ARMI Alert**: `[Cosmic Compliance Signal Detected]`

3. **The Offer**:
   - The text appears in the air, written in "Universal Standard" (which looks like stock ticker symbols).
   - **Position**: Regional Auditor (Probationary).
   - **Perks**: Access to "Galactic Exchange" (buy usage of other worlds' assets), immunity to local laws.
   - **Cost**: The "Compliance Shackle." 50% of all future yields go to the Consortium. Absolute obedience to Board directives.

4. **The Negotiation**:
   - Victor refuses to sign a standard contract. "50% overhead is for employees. I'm a Partner."
   - He uses his `[Restructurer]` class to *redline* the cosmic contract.
   - He leverages his unique position: The Consortium *needs* someone to clean up Terra-Insolvia (a failing world).
   - The Ledger resists. He applies `[Aggressive Negotiations]` to a piece of paper. The paper bleeds ink.

5. **The Counter-Offer**:
   - Victor writes his own terms.
   - **Split**: 90/10 (Standard Finder's Fee).
   - **Autonomy**: Full operational control.
   - **Title**: Not "Auditor." "Independent Contractor."

## 4. The Cliffhanger
The Void Ledger flashes. The terms are... **ACCEPTED**.
But with a rider: *Target: One million Gold Yield within 30 days. Failure = Liquidation.*
Victor smiles. "Acceptable parameters."
He looks at the map of Oakhaven. It's time to go home and make some real money.

## 5. Key Checklists
- [ ] Victor analyzes the contract like a lawyer shark.
- [ ] Hestia's reaction to him *holding* the envelope (fear/respect).
- [ ] ARMI system messages for the Cosmic Contract.
- [ ] Tone: High-stakes corporate horror.
