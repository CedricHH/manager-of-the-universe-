## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The New Recruits

The 12 former-hostile goblins are separate from the originals.
They eat last. They work first.
**Probation**: Victor's word for "prove yourself."

The original 14 are smug. They have seniority.

### Beat 2: The Tension

One original goblin (Guard-2) bullies a new recruit.
He takes his ration.
Victor watches.

This isn't disobedience to Victor. It's internal hierarchy.
Victor needs to address it without undermining Guard-2's role.

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Solution

Victor calls a "Meeting" (All goblins in the chamber).
He announces a new system: **Merit Points**.

> "Every goblin starts at 0."
> "Good work = +1. Bad work = -1."
> "Highest points at week's end = Extra ration + 'Shiny'."

He holds up a piece of Marcus's golden armor trim.
The goblins' eyes go wide. **Shiny**.

### Beat 4: Implementation

Victor assigns point-tracking to Sniv.
Sniv uses a rock with scratch marks.
It's crude, but it works.

Guard-2 approaches Victor later.
> "How Guard-2 get points?"
> Victor: "Don't steal from coworkers. Do your job. Report problems."

Guard-2 nods. He returns the stolen ration.

### Beat 5: Sniv's Growth

Sniv is eating regularly now.
He's... less pathetic.
His posture is straighter. His voice is clearer.
**ARMI Note**: `[Subject SNIV: Evolution progress 15%.]`

Victor notices.
> "Sniv, you look taller."
> Sniv: "Sniv feels... stronger. Is because of points?"
> Victor: "It's because you're not starving anymore."

### Beat 6: Floor 3 Optimization

With 26 goblins, Victor expands operations:
- Floor 2: Full mushroom farming
- Floor 3: Mining operations (Copper deposits found)
- Floor 5: Central command + Storage

The dungeon is becoming... organized.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Discovery

A mining goblin finds something in Floor 3.
Not copper. **Iron**.
And next to the iron vein: A skeleton. Human. Old.
Wearing rusted armor.
Holding a scroll.

### Beat 8: The Scroll

Victor examines the scroll.
**ARMI Translation**:
> "If you read this, I have failed."
> "The beast below cannot be killed."
> "Signed, Sir Kael of the Silver Dawn."

**Date**: 50 years ago.

Victor looks at the stairs to Floor 4.
The "beast below" is Asterion.
And someone died trying to kill him... with a full party.
