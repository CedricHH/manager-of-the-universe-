# Outline: Chapter 115 - The Delegation

**Word Target**: 1,800-2,000 words

## Continuity Verification
- [x] Merchant Coalition is NEW faction interaction (not previously negotiated)
- [x] Lord Cassius Valorian is unique character (new introduction)
- [x] Conflict type: Political negotiation (varies from military in Ch 113)

---

## Hook (250-350 words)

**Opening**: Merchant Coalition delegation arrives at Ironhold. Three representatives, heavy guard. Victor observes from the war room—analyzes their hierarchy before meeting.

**Key Elements**:
- ARMI [Performance Review] active: Scans each delegate
- Lead negotiator: Lord Cassius Valorian (mid-40s, trade magnate, Level 14 Merchant class)
- Second: Lady Thessaly Morthane (House Morthane, banker, risk analyst)
- Third: Captain Dren Kieran (House Kieran, arms dealer, military escort commander)
- Each house sent their most *cautious* member—they're hedging, not committing

**Hook**: "They're not here to ally. They're here to evaluate whether we're worth betting on."

## Development (1,100-1,400 words)

### Beat 1: The Opening Gambit (~400 words)
**Negotiation Setup**: War room converted to conference space. Dravik, Victor, Sera at table. Resh at door (intimidation factor).

**Valorian's position**: "The Coalition has maintained profitable neutrality for 18 months. You're asking us to pick a side. What guarantee do you offer?"

**Victor's counter**: "I offer you the *only* side that produces long-term profit. Revolutionary victory means nationalization. You lose everything. Coalition victory means restored trade routes. You keep your margins."

**Morthane's objection**: "Consortium agents have a reputation for extraction, not reconstruction. Three previous teams tried to *steal* the Bank, not save it."

**Victor's gamble**: Shows his death mark (golden glyph near heart). "Clause 47-Delta. If I fail, this kills me. I'm not extraction—I'm investment. My survival depends on successful outcome."

### Beat 2: The Sticking Points (~400 words)
**Three demands from Coalition**:
1. **Equity guarantee**: 25% stake in recovered Bank assets (Victor already offered)
2. **Trade route priority**: First access to restored commercial networks
3. **Protection clause**: Consortium cannot nationalize Coalition assets post-recovery

**Victor's counterdemands**:
1. 12,000 mercenaries deployed to Ironhold defense
2. Supply chain access (food, ammunition, medical)
3. Information sharing on Revolutionary movements

**Impasse**: Coalition wants guarantees Victor can't unilaterally provide. Consortium authority required.

**Solution**: Victor contacts Kira (Consortium liaison) via ARMI emergency channel. Kira's response:
> "Equity guarantee approved. Trade route priority: conditional on Coalition combat contribution. Protection clause: requires Board review. 6-hour response window."

**Provisional agreement**: Coalition will provide supplies immediately. Mercenaries pending final contract terms.

### Beat 3: The Betrayal Risk (~400 words)
**Private moment**: Sera pulls Victor aside.

**Sera's warning**: "House Kieran is selling weapons to the Revolutionaries. They're hedging both sides."

**Evidence**: Intercepts showing arms shipments to Revolutionary supply lines *during* this negotiation.

**Victor's choice**: Expose Kieran (collapses entire negotiation) or use as leverage (risk future betrayal).

**Decision**: Victor approaches Captain Kieran privately.

> "I know about the arms sales. I don't care about the past. I care about the future. Stop the shipments now, or I inform Lord Valorian that House Kieran is compromising coalition security."

**Kieran's response**: Surprise, then calculation. "You're more pragmatic than previous Consortium agents. Very well. Shipments cease."

**Subtext**: Kieran respects the leverage play. Victor made an enemy who respects him—dangerous but manageable.

## Cliffhanger (250-350 words)

**Coalition provisional agreement signed**. Supplies begin flowing immediately. 4,000 mercenaries committed (House Valorian + Morthane). House Kieran "considering" contribution.

**ARMI update**:
> **[ARMI: COALITION STATUS]**
> Merchant Coalition: PROVISIONAL ALLY
> Mercenary Commitment: 4,000 (8,000 pending)
> Supply Access: ACTIVE
> Betrayal Risk Assessment: 34%

**Final scene**: Coalition delegation departs. Valorian's parting words:

> "You've bought 4,000 soldiers. Not loyalty. If this fails, we'll negotiate with whoever's left standing."

**Escalation**: Sera reports Revolutionary movement.

> **[SERA: INTELLIGENCE UPDATE]**
> Revolutionary vanguard deployed. 5,000 troops, 18-hour ETA.
> Full army follows: 25,000 troops, 42-hour ETA.
> Assessment: Vex is testing coalition cohesion before main assault.

**CLIFFHANGER**: First battle with coalition forces. Will the mercenaries actually fight, or fold when contact is made?

**Final ARMI Message**:
> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 3, HOUR 6]**
> **[REVOLUTIONARY VANGUARD: 18 HOURS]**
> **[COALITION STATUS: PROVISIONAL]**
> **[MISSION CLOCK: 117 DAYS, 13 HOURS REMAINING]**

## Key Character Notes

**Victor**: Master negotiator. Uses death clause as trust-building (unusual leverage). Handles Kieran betrayal pragmatically.

**Valorian**: Pragmatic merchant lord. Respects Victor's arguments but won't overcommit.

**Morthane**: Risk-averse banker. Skeptical of Consortium historically.

**Kieran**: Arms dealer playing both sides. Victor's leverage creates grudging respect, not loyalty.

**Sera**: Critical intelligence on Kieran. Enables Victor's private leverage play.

---

## Thematic Notes

Coalition building requires pragmatism, not idealism. Victor isn't making friends—he's aligning incentives. The question isn't whether allies are trustworthy, but whether betrayal costs more than loyalty.

**Key Line**: "Trust is inefficient. Aligned incentives are reliable."
