## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Night in the Dungeon

Victor lies on the throne (Still uncomfortable).
He can't sleep.
The adrenaline from Asterion's meeting hasn't faded.
He almost died today. He negotiated his way out.

He closes his eyes.
**The memory surfaces.**

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 2: FLASHBACK - The Empty Months (1.5 Years Ago)

**Setting**: Victor's apartment. Still expensive. Still empty.

He has the USB drive.
He hasn't opened it yet.
He just... exists.
Wakes up. Stares at walls. Drinks. Sleeps.

### Beat 3: The Media Storm

The TV is always on.
> "Victor Kaine, once a rising star, now facing 15 federal charges..."
> "The 'Chainsaw' has been cut down..."
His old nickname. Earned for restructurings. Now a slur.

### Beat 4: The Visitors

**Day 30**: His lawyer visits.
> "Victor, if you plead guilty, you might get 10 years instead of 25."
Victor doesn't respond.

**Day 60**: His mother calls.
He doesn't answer.

**Day 90**: Elena Chen (His betrayer) sends flowers. With a card:
> "I'm sorry it had to be you. - E"
He burns the flowers.

### Beat 5: The USB Drive

**Day 150**: Victor finally opens the USB.
Contents:
- Internal emails (Board members discussing the cover-up)
- Financial records (The money trail)
- A video (A factory in the Congo. Children. Death.)

**The Truth**: The conflict minerals scandal killed 47 people. Including 12 children.
Victor didn't know. But his signature is on the contracts.

### Beat 6: The Weight

Victor stares at the video.
He was complicit. Unknowingly. But still.
He spent his life optimizing. Cutting costs. Increasing efficiency.
And this is where the efficiency led.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: Back to the Dungeon

Victor opens his eyes.
The dungeon is dark. Quiet.
Sniv is asleep nearby.

Victor looks at his hands.
Different body. Same guilt.

### Beat 8: The Resolve

He stands.
He can't undo the past.
But he can build something different.
Something where efficiency doesn't require bodies.

> "Sniv. Wake up."
> Sniv: "Mmph... Boss?"
> Victor: "New project. I need you to count every trap in this dungeon."
> "We're going to make them... less lethal."

## Checklist

- [x] **Flashback**: The Aftermath (6 months of depression)
- [x] **Revelation**: The USB contents (Conflict minerals, children)
- [x] **Character**: Victor's guilt emerges
- [x] **Shift**: Victor wants "less lethal" – First moral change

---

## Notes for Writing

- **Tone**: Heavy. This is Victor's lowest point.
- **The Video**: Don't show graphic details. Imply. Let reader fill gaps.
- **Moral Shift**: Subtle. He's not becoming "good." He's becoming aware.

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
