## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Road

Day 1 of travel.

Victor walks the ancient road toward Oakhaven. Zip occasionally pokes head out of bag.

The landscape: forests, farmland, occasional ruins.

**ARMI Commentary**:
> Observation: This world's infrastructure is poorly maintained.
> Opportunity: Transportation sector ripe for disruption.

Victor: "One thing at a time."

### Beat 2: Other Travelers

Victor passes traders, pilgrims, and adventurers heading toward the dungeon zone.

A merchant recognizes his "trade goods":

> "Those slime cores! Where'd you get them? Quality like that comes from managed dungeons..."

Victor: "Private supplier. Exclusive contract."

The merchant's eyes gleam: "If you're ever selling wholesale..."

Victor takes his name. First potential customer.

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Checkpoint

Day 2. A bridge crossing.

**Lord Sterling's Toll Station**: Soldiers block the road.

Guard: "Toll is 5 GP per traveler. 10 GP for merchants."

Victor: "For a public road?"

Guard: "Lord Sterling owns this bridge. His land, his rules."

### Beat 4: The Observation

Victor pays (10 GP, merchant rate).

But he observes:
- Soldiers are well-equipped but bored
- The toll system is inefficient (one checkpoint, no receipts)
- Other travelers grumble but pay

**ARMI Analysis**:
> Lord Sterling: Local noble
> Territory: Controls trade routes near Oakhaven
> Revenue Model: Toll extraction, land taxes
> Assessment: Extractive, not productive. Vulnerable to competition.

Victor files this away.

### Beat 5: The Encounter

Past the checkpoint, Victor notices he's being followed.

Two men. Professional. Not guards—something else.

Victor doesn't run. He picks a clearing and waits.

They approach.

> "You. Merchant. Lord Sterling would like a word about your... goods."

Victor: "I'm a simple trader."

> "Those slime cores aren't simple. Where's your dungeon access permit?"

**Complication**: Victor doesn't have one. Didn't know he needed one.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 6: The Ultimatum

The men draw weapons.

> "Come quietly, or we take you by force. Lord Sterling has questions."

Victor calculates:
- Two opponents (Level 8-10 estimated)
- He's Level 1
- Zip is in the bag (useless in combat)
- [Aggressive Negotiations] costs GP per second
- He has 40 GP left

**Options**:
1. Fight (expensive, risky)
2. Negotiate (requires leverage)
3. Surrender (gather information)

### Beat 7: The Choice

Victor smiles.

> "Before you decide to 'take me by force'—consider this."

He pulls out a single premium mana crystal from his bag.

> "This is worth 100 GP. I have access to more. Lots more. Now... do you want to drag a beaten merchant to your lord? Or bring him a business opportunity?"

The men hesitate.

> "What kind of opportunity?"

Victor: "The kind that makes Lord Sterling richer than toll roads ever could. Take me to him. **As a guest.**"

## Notes for Writing

- **Lord Sterling**: Not yet on page. Build him through his men and systems.
- **The Toll**: Economic worldbuilding. Extractive nobles = inefficient.
- **The Ultimatum**: Victor's first surface test. Can he talk his way out?
- **Zip**: Stays silent (mostly) in bag. Comic tension.

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
