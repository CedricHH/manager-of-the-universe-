## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Preparation

Sniv is terrified.
Victor prepares him:
- A cloak (Made from rat pelts)
- A "disguise" (Mud on face, hunched posture)
- A mission: Go to the nearest road, observe, report

### Beat 2: The Exit

Victor leads Sniv to Floor 1.
The original dungeon entrance: A collapsed temple.
Sunlight streams through the cracks.
Sniv hisses. "It burns!"
Victor: "That's just the sun. You'll adapt."

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Surface (Sniv's POV)

Sniv crawls out.
The world is **vast**. Sky. Trees. Wind.
He's never seen any of it.
He freezes. Overloaded.

Then he hears voices.
Humans. On a road. 100 meters away.

### Beat 4: The Observation

Sniv hides behind a rock.
He sees:
- A merchant cart (Heading somewhere)
- Two guards (Bored, talking)
- A signpost: "Oakhaven - 5 leagues"

He listens:
> Guard 1: "Did you hear? The old temple dungeon is active again."
> Guard 2: "Bullshit. That place has been empty for years."
> Guard 1: "Swear. Goblins were spotted near the entrance."

### Beat 5: The Return

Sniv runs back to the dungeon.
He reports everything.

Victor processes:
- The dungeon is already known (passively)
- Oakhaven is nearby (A city = adventurers)
- The dungeon is considered "empty"

### Beat 6: The Marketing Strategy

Victor realizes: The dungeon's reputation is **low**.
No one comes because no one thinks there's treasure.
He needs to change that perception.

> "We need bait. Something valuable. Something visible."
> "Marcus's glowing sword. We put it somewhere adventurers can *almost* reach."

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Deadline

Day 2 of Asterion's ultimatum.
24 hours left.
Victor doesn't have adventurers yet.
He needs to buy time.

### Beat 8: The Interim Payment

Victor sends the imp back with a message:
> "The Manager acknowledges Asterion's claim."
> "A sample tribute will be delivered as proof of good faith."
> "Full payment pending... renegotiation of terms."

He attaches the one thing of value he can spare:
**Sir Kael's rusted sword** (Found with the skeleton).
Not valuable. But symbolic.
A reminder that Asterion has killed heroes before.
A promise that more are coming.
