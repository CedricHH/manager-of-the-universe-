# Outline: Chapter 113 - The Siege Protocol

**Word Target**: 1,800-2,000 words

## Continuity Verification
- [x] Faction conflict (Revolutionary vs Warlord) NOT previously resolved
- [x] Tribune Cassian Vex is unique antagonist (introduced Ch 112)
- [x] Battle/military conflict is NEW conflict type for Victor (previously economic/political)

---

## Hook (250-350 words)

**Opening**: In media res - battle already joined. Artillery impact, shield strain, Victor's analytical assessment of the tactical situation. Focus on the *sensory overload* of first real combat for Victor.

**Key Elements**:
- Victor processing "Combat Metrics" like quarterly reports - casualties as "asset depreciation"
- Resh deploying into the fight immediately (combat specialist showcase)
- Wall breach imminent (2 minutes until critical failure)
- ARMI battle interface activated (new HUD for combat situations)

**Hook**: First direct combat experience. Victor realizes this isn't Oakhaven - he can't negotiate with artillery.

## Development (1,100-1,400 words)

### Beat 1: The First Wave (~400 words)
**The Problem**: Northern wall breach. Revolutionary mages overwhelming Warlord defenses. 80 soldiers holding against 300+ attackers.

**Victor's Approach**: Resource allocation. Can't fight - but can *manage* the defense.
- Identifies ammunition shortage (30 minutes of sustained fire)
- Notices mage rotation inefficiency (40 mages, only 15 active at any time)
- Calculates wall structural integrity declining (3-minute intervals between impacts)

**Action**: Victor assumes "Command & Control" position. Begins issuing tactical recommendations:
- "Rotate mage groups every 4 minutes - maximize sustained output"
- "Concentrate archers on mage positions - their shields are weaker than infantry armor"
- "Pull 20 soldiers from eastern wall - they're probing, not attacking"

**Dravik's reaction**: Skeptical but listens. First correction works (mage output increases 40%).

### Beat 2: Resh Unleashed (~400 words)
**Resh's Showcase**: Level 18 Combat Specialist demonstrates Tier 4 capability.

**Visual**: Resh doesn't fight conventionally. Anti-magic aura clears 10-meter radius. Revolutionary mages can't target him. His movement through the battlefield is described like "a corporate restructuring" - systematic, efficient, *terrifying*.

**Victor's Analysis**: "Resh isn't fighting. He's *auditing* their combat effectiveness. And finding it insufficient."

**Key Moment**: Revolutionary Captain challenges Resh (Level 14). Resh defeats him in 12 seconds without drawing weapons - pure martial arts. Takes Captain's insignia as "proof of claim."

**ARMI Message**: 
> **[ARMI: COMBAT ANALYTICS]**
> Hostile Asset Value: 47,000 GP (combined force)
> Current Depreciation Rate: 340 GP/minute
> Status: ACCELERATING

### Beat 3: The Breakthrough (~400 words)
**Crisis**: Tribune Cassian Vex personally leads reinforcement wave. Level 17, battle mage. Barrier magic that counters Resh's anti-magic.

**Mira's Intelligence**: "Vex is vulnerable. His barrier requires concentration. Disrupt focus, barrier fails."

**Victor's Strategy**: Deploys Mira's intel. Coordinates Warlord artillery on specific timing - synchronized distraction while Dravik's honor guard flanks.

**Result**: Barrier disrupted for 4 seconds. Resh closes distance. Vex forced to retreat (wounded, not killed - he escapes).

**Revolutionary Withdrawal**: Without Vex, assault collapses. 400+ casualties on Revolutionary side. Warlords: 47 dead, 120 wounded.

**ARMI Update**:
> **[ARMI: BATTLE REPORT]**
> Ironhold Status: DEFENDED
> Victor's Role: Tactical Advisor (verified)
> Dravik Loyalty Shift: +23 points
> Note: "Soldier's respect" earned. Negotiation leverage increased.

## Cliffhanger (250-350 words)

**Aftermath Scene**: Dawn. Fires smoldering. Victor stands on damaged wall surveying Revolutionary retreat.

**Dravik Approaches**: Different tone. Not "interrogating" anymore. "Consortium agent" becomes "advisor who helped save my fortress."

**Dravik's Offer**: "You fought for us. Not many do. Perhaps your 'coalition' proposal deserves consideration. But first—you need to understand what we're actually fighting for."

**Revelation Setup**: Dravik hints at deeper conspiracy. "The Bank isn't just gold. It's leverage. Everyone wants it because controlling Terra-Solvaris's financial system means controlling the reconstruction. And there are those *beyond* the factions who want it."

**CLIFFHANGER**: 
- Cassian Vex's message arrives via magical projection: "You saved Dravik today. Tomorrow, we burn you both. The Revolution waits for no one. 72-hour ultimatum: Surrender the Bank—or face the full Revolutionary Army."

**Final ARMI Message**:
> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 2]**
> **[IRONHOLD: DAMAGED BUT OPERATIONAL]**
> **[REVOLUTIONARY ULTIMATUM: 72 HOURS]**
> **[MISSION CLOCK: 118 DAYS, 19 HOURS REMAINING]**

## Key Character Notes

**Victor**: First real combat. He can't fight—but he can *manage* a battle. His contribution is logistics, timing, resource allocation. Proves value through what he knows, not what he can hit.

**Resh**: Combat showcase. Level 18 means he's not in danger—he *is* the danger. Anti-magic aura, martial mastery. "Auditing their effectiveness."

**Mira**: Intelligence enabler. Identifies Vex's weakness. Team synergy demonstration.

**Dravik**: Shifts from suspicious antagonist to reluctant ally. Victor earns "soldier's respect" through performance under fire.

**Cassian Vex**: Antagonist established. Wounded but not defeated. Sets up ongoing conflict.

## Thematic Notes

This chapter demonstrates Victor's value in unfamiliar territory. He's not a fighter—but warfare is still *resource management*. By applying corporate logic to combat logistics, he proves useful even in a domain where his skills seem irrelevant.

**Key Line**: "In Oakhaven, I managed inventory. Here, the inventory shoots back. Same math, higher stakes."
