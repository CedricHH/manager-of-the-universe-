## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Morning Routine

Victor wakes at The Silver Standard.

**Morning Activities**:

- Identifies Guild headquarters locations
- Plans Merchant Guild licensing visit
- Zip excited about city exploration

### Beat 2: The Breakfast Meeting

Victor goes to inn common room for breakfast.

Someone's already at his table.

**The Watcher** (revealed):
- Woman, 30s, professional attire
- Guild Inspector badge visible
- Drinking coffee, reading reports
- Clearly waited for Victor

Her: "Merchant Kaine. Mind if we talk business?"

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Introduction

**Character**: Elena Cross, Merchant Guild Senior Inspector

Not hostile. Professional interest.

Elena: "You activated a Consortium waypoint yesterday. That's... notable. We monitor institutional activity in Oakhaven. It's part of my job."

Victor: "Guild surveillance of merchants?"

Elena: "Guild protection of commerce. When someone brings century-dead infrastructure online, I want to know if they're opportunity or threat."

### Beat 4: The Assessment

Elena's already researched Victor:
- Sterling's endorsement (verified)
- Dungeon operation claims (investigated partially)
- Institutional backing (Consortium card confirmed via sources)
- Performance metrics (rumor of organized dungeon)

She's offering: Expedited licensing in exchange for information sharing.

Elena: "Lord Sterling vouched for you. That carries weight. But Sterling's territorial, not commercial. I represent the people who actually move goods. We want to know: Are you competition, or opportunity?"

### Beat 5: The Negotiation

Victor considers.

Guild membership = legitimacy, but also oversight.

He offers compromise:
- Information sharing (limited, commercial focus)
- Guild licensing (expedited, full merchant rights)
- Exclusivity clause: Victor gets first refusal on any dungeon goods trade the Guild facilitates in region

Elena counters:
- Guild wants quarterly briefings on dungeon product capabilities
- Victor gets preferential trade routes
- Mutual benefit: Guild expands dungeon goods market, Victor gets distribution channels

### Beat 6: The Real Reason

Elena leans forward: "Here's why I'm really talking to you."

The Guild has a problem.

**The Alchemist Cartel**: Controls potion trade, inflates prices, squeezes independent merchants. Guild can't break them without alternative supply.

Victor's organized dungeon = potential alternative supplier.

Elena: "You flood the market with quality slime cores and processed potions, the cartel's pricing collapses. Guild supports that. Enthusiastically."

Victor sees the play: Elena wants him to wage economic war on the Alchemists. Guild provides cover.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Agreement

Victor agrees. Conditional.

"I'll target the Alchemist pricing structure. In exchange: Guild licensing, trade routes, and you look the other way when I optimize operations that might... bend traditional regulations."

Elena smiles: "Define 'bend.'"

Victor: "Dungeon employment contracts. Monster unionization. Non-lethal adventurer management. Consortium restructuring protocols applied to local commerce."

Elena: "That's not bending regulations. That's rewriting them." Pause. "I'll need documentation. Proof your model works. The Guild Council won't approve based on promises."

Victor: "Give me two weeks. I'll provide quarterly revenue reports, casualty-reduction metrics, and efficiency comparisons versus traditional dungeon operations."

Elena extends hand: "Deal. Welcome to the Merchant Guild, Administrator Kaine."

They shake.

### Beat 8: The Warning

As Elena stands to leave:

Elena: "One warning. The Alchemist Cartel has... connections. Church, nobility, even some Adventurer Guild officers. When you crash their prices, expect retaliation."

Victor: "What kind?"

Elena: "Legal challenges, supply sabotage, maybe hired adventurer 'accidents.' They play dirty. Just... be ready."

Victor: "I wrote the playbook on corporate warfare. I'll manage."

Elena: "I believe you." She pauses at the door. "That Consortium waypoint you activated? You're not the first Restructurer who's come to Oakhaven. The last one disappeared sixteen years ago. We never found out why."

She leaves.

Victor processes: Another Restructurer. Disappeared. 

**Questions**: Who? What happened? Connected to Restructurer #1's rebellion?
