## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Emergency Meeting

Victor gathers his "Board" (Sniv + the 4 team leads).
He explains the situation.
> "The Minotaur wants payment. We have 3 days."

### Beat 2: Options Analysis

Victor lists the options:
1. **Pay** (Food/Gold): Lose resources, appear weak
2. **Fight** (Souls): Die (Asterion is Lv 25)
3. **Flee** (Abandon dungeon): Start over with nothing
4. **Negotiate** (???): Risky

The goblins vote: "Run."
Victor shakes his head.
> "We don't run. We find leverage."

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: Intelligence Gathering

Victor sends scouts (the sneakiest goblins) to observe Floor 4.
They report:
- Asterion paces his chamber alone
- He talks to himself
- He seems... bored
- He eats rats (not goblins—not worth the effort)

### Beat 4: The Weakness

Victor analyzes Asterion via **[Performance Review]** (from a distance):
> **[Asterion - Minotaur Guardian]**
> Level: 25 (Boss)
> HP: ??? (High)
> Status: Bored, Lonely, Purposeless
> Weakness: **Existential Ennui**

### Beat 5: The Insight

Victor realizes: Asterion isn't hungry. He's **test**.
If Victor pays tribute, Asterion sees him as prey.
If Victor fights, Asterion kills him.
If Victor offers something Asterion **wants** (not needs)...

What does a bored immortal want?
**Entertainment. Purpose. A worthy opponent.**

### Beat 6: The Plan Forms

Victor drafts a counter-offer:
> "I don't pay tribute. I offer partnership."
> "I bring you worthy fights. You protect the dungeon."

It's insane. No goblin would volunteer for Asterion's "entertainment."
Unless...

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Source

Victor remembers: The dead hero's scroll mentioned "Sir Kael of the Silver Dawn."
If heroes have come before, heroes will come again.
Victor doesn't need to feed Asterion his goblins.
He needs to feed him **adventurers**.

### Beat 8: The Risk

To get adventurers, the dungeon needs to be **known**.
That means exposure. That means the outside world.
That means Victor stops hiding.

> "Sniv. I need you to do something dangerous."
> "I need you to leave the dungeon."

Sniv's eyes go wide.
> "The... outside?"
