---

---

## Previously

Chapter 4 ended with:
- Successful slime hunt (15 jellies = food for 1 day)
- Discovery of the Rat Nest (Alpha Rat Level 5)
- Victor bribed the rats with jelly (Truce?)

---

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Truce

The Alpha Rat licks the jelly.
It looks at Victor. Assessing.
Victor holds up another jelly.
> "One a day. You don't eat my people. I don't burn your nest."

The Alpha tilts its head. Sniffs.
It retreats into the nest. The pack follows.

**Result**: Not a contract. An understanding.
Victor just made his first "trade deal" with vermin.

### Beat 2: The Return

Victor's team returns to the Boss Chamber (Floor 5).
The waiting goblins are restless. Hungry.

Victor throws the bag of jellies on the ground.
> "Dinner. Ration it. One per goblin."

They descend like locusts.
For the first time, Victor sees something other than fear in their eyes.
**Gratitude?** No. **Hope**.

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: Establishing Order

Victor doesn't let them rest.
> "Eating is break time. Break time is 15 minutes. Then we work."

**Tasks Assigned**:
- 4 goblins: Clean the Boss Chamber (Hygiene = Health)
- 4 goblins: Collect mushrooms from Floor 2 (Variety)
- 4 goblins: Stand guard at the stairs (Security)
- Sniv: Inventory management (Counting the jellies)

### Beat 4: The First Wage

Victor has ~30 GP worth of slime materials (if sold).
But he can't sell them. He needs them.

Instead, he experiments with the **acid sacs**.
He squeezes one onto a rock.
It burns. Smokes.
> "Corrosive. Weaponizable."

**New Asset**: Acid Grenades (Potential).

### Beat 5: Night Falls

The dungeon doesn't have day/night.
But Victor's body does.
He's exhausted. 16+ hours awake.

He assigns Sniv to "Night Watch."
> "If anything moves that isn't ours, wake me."

He lies on the throne (still uncomfortable).
He closes his eyes.

### Beat 6: The Dream (Flashback Deepening)

**Memory Fragment (Dream)**:
- A woman's voice: "Victor, you can't just cut 200 jobs."
- Victor's response: "The numbers don't lie, Sarah. The division is bleeding."
- A door slamming.
- An empty apartment.

He wakes up. 4 hours have passed.
Sniv is staring at him.
> "Boss made water from eyes. Is leaking?"
> Victor: "It's called... condensation. The caves are damp."

He doesn't remember the dream clearly.
But he feels **hollow**.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Noise

The ground trembles.
A distant roar. Deep. Primal.
From **Floor 4**.

The goblins freeze.
> Sniv: "Big thing. Cow-man. He wake."

**ARMI Alert**:
> Seismic Activity Detected.
> Source: Floor 4 Guardian Chamber.
> Entity: ASTERION (Minotaur, Lv 25).
> Status: Agitated.

Victor looks at the stairs leading down.
> "The neighbors are noisy."
> "For now, we reinforce the doors. Nobody goes below Floor 3."

**End of "Dead Capital" Phase**.
Victor has: Food, Shelter, Employees.
He doesn't have: Safety, Capital, Answers.
And something very big is waiting below.

## Notes for Writing

- **Tone**: Cautiously optimistic. Small wins.
- **Victor**: Starting to settle into "Manager" mode.
- **The Dream**: Keep it vague. "Sarah" is a name that will mean more later.
