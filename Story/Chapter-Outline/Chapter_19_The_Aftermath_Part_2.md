## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Trap Audit

Victor and Sniv walk through the dungeon.
Victor examines each trap:
- Spike pit (Lethal) → Fill with mud (Injuring)
- Swinging blade (Lethal) → Remove blade, keep swing (Knockback)
- Poison darts (Lethal) → Replace with sleep darts (Non-lethal)

Sniv is confused.
> "Boss... why not kill? Kill is efficient."
> Victor: "Dead adventurers don't talk. Injured ones spread stories."

### Beat 2: The Real Reason

Victor doesn't say it aloud:
He doesn't want to be the person who kills children.
Even indirectly.

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: FLASHBACK - The Decision (1 Year Ago)

**Setting**: Victor's apartment. Night.

He's watched the video 100 times.
He has the evidence.
He could release it. Destroy the Board.
But he'd go to prison anyway.

**The Question**: Is it worth it?

### Beat 4: The Call

His phone rings.
Unknown number.
He answers.
> "Mr. Kaine. I know what you have."
> "I'm a reporter. Sarah gave me your number."
> "If you give me the drive, I can end this."

### Beat 5: The Leap

Victor thinks.
If he gives the evidence, the Board falls.
The children get justice.
And Victor... probably dies.

> "Meet me in 24 hours. The old server farm."
> "I'll have everything."

He hangs up.
He knows this is a one-way trip.
But for the first time in months, he feels... something.

### Beat 6: The Night Before

Victor cleans his apartment.
He writes a letter (Never sent).
He doesn't sleep.

At dawn, he takes the USB and drives.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: Back to the Dungeon

Victor snaps back.
He's standing in front of a spike trap (Now mud-filled).
Sniv: "Boss? You went away again."

Victor looks at the trap.
> "It's not about efficiency, Sniv."
> "It's about what we're willing to become."

### Beat 8: The Signal

**ARMI Alert**:
> Perimeter Activity Detected.
> Entities: 6
> Classification: Adventurer Party (High-Level)
> Note: The Silver Lance has returned. With reinforcements.

They came back.
And this time, they brought help.
