# Outline: Chapter 64 - The Capital Injection

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

## Hook
Victor stands before the sealed entrance to **Floor 4**.
He holds the "Capital Key" (a magical representation of the 10,000 GP loan).
Valerius: "If we open this, the interest clock starts ticking."
Victor: "Time is money. Open it."

## Development
### Beat 1: The Expansion
They unlock Floor 4. It's a "Blank Slate" biome.
Victor chooses the theme: **The Jungle of Avarice**.
Why? Because the "Loot Futures" contract incentivizes rare drops. Jungles have high biodiversity = high loot table variance.
He hires a new designated "Floor Boss": **Gorg, the Ape King** (a retired heavy-weight monster champion).
Cost: 2,000 GP signing bonus.

### Beat 2: The Stress Test
The "Loot Futures" model requires high turnover.
Victor implements "Fast-Travel" points (teleporters) to get adventurers to Floor 4 faster.
Roland (The Paladin) tries to block the teleporters claiming "Safety usage violation."
Victor counters with the Royal Charter: "It's not a teleporter; it's a 'Rapid Transit Initiative'."
Roland backs down but logs the "violation."

### Beat 3: The First Yield
The first wave of "Whale" adventurers (wealthy risk-takers attracted by the new floor) arrives.
They fight Gorg.
A rare item drops: **[The Banana of Wisdom]** (Epic Consumable).
Value: 5,000 GP.
Bank's Cut (20%): 1,000 GP.
Malcom sends a message via magic pigeon: "Yield accepted. Tranche 2 unlocked."

## Cliffhanger
Victor is exhausted but successful. The system works.
Then, a notification from the Core (Nova).
**Nova**: "Hey Boss. The Jungle feels... wrong."
**Victor**: "Wrong how?"
**Nova**: "I didn't spawn the mosquitoes. And they are eating the mana."
Something came in with the Bank's money. A "Financial Parasite" hidden in the magic of the loan?
**Status**: Rich, expanding, but infected.

## Checklist
- [ ] Establish Floor 4 theme (Jungle)
- [ ] Show the mechanics of "Loot Futures" in action
- [ ] Highlight the friction with Roland regarding "Rapid Transit"
- [ ] Introduce the "Corruption/Parasite" plotline (The hidden cost of the loan)
