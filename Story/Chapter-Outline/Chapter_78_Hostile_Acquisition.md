# Chapter Outline: Chapter 78 - Hostile Acquisition

- **Title**: Hostile Acquisition
- **POV**: Victor Kaine

- **Cliffhanger**: The Adventurer's Guild receives notice that their primary headquarters in Oakhaven is now under Victor's management.

## 2. Pacing & Tone
- **Tone**: Cold, surgical, and triumphant in a way that feels like a balance sheet balancing.
- **Pacing**: Rapid-fire business negotiations interspersed with ARMI status updates.
- **Corporate Focus**: Leverage, debt buying, and asset-backed securities.

## 3. The Beats

### I. The Capital Surge
- **Setting**: The quiet serenity of Victor's office immediately following the "destruction" of Rivercrest.
- **Action**: The 85,000 GP settles into Victor's account. He doesn't celebrate; he allocates.
- **ARMI Message**: Allocation of funds to "Project: Corporate Raider."

### II. Identifying the Weak Points
- **The Scene**: Victor uses his intelligence from Voros and the Merchant Guild to identify that the Alchemist’s Guild and the Mercenary Guild over-leveraged themselves to fund the "audit expedition."
- **Visual**: A virtual map of Oakhaven assets being "painted" red (Victor's color) as he buys up their debt.

### III. The Negotiation with Voros
- **The Scene**: A quick, high-stakes communication with Voros.
- **The Deal**: Victor buys the Alchemist's Guild's potion-supply debt. He now controls their ingredients.
- **Victor's Logic**: "If they want to audit me, I'll audit their supply chain."

### IV. The News Reaches the Front
- **The Scene**: Back at the ruins of Rivercrest. Guildmaster Groll is still celebrating when he gets a messenger bird.
- **The Reaction**: Horror as he realizes his laboratories in the city have been foreclosed upon.
- **Elara's View**: She sees Victor's play. It’s cleaner than a sword, but just as lethal.

### V. The Cliffhanger
- **Action**: Victor signs the final deed for the Oakhaven Regional Adventurer's Hub.
- **Final Visual**: ARMI blinking: `[HOSTILE ACQUISITION 100% COMPLETE]`.
