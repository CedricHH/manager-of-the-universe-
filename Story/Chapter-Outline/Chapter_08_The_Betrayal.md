## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Aftermath

Victor sits in his "office" (The Boss Chamber).
The new goblins are being processed by Sniv.
Names... no. Numbers.
"Labor-13, Labor-14..."

Sniv approaches Victor.
> "Boss. New gobs scared but follow. They see Boss burn Alpha. They loyal now."

Victor looks at Sniv.
Small. Loyal. Willing to die for him.

### Beat 2: The Trigger

Sniv adds:
> "Sniv not scared of Boss. Sniv trust."

**Trust**.
The word cuts deeper than acid.

Victor closes his eyes.
The dungeon fades.
**The memory rushes back.**

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: FLASHBACK - The Boardroom (3 Years Ago)

**Setting**: Kaine Industries, 47th Floor.
Glass walls. Manhattan skyline.
Victor sits at the head of the table.

The Board Members are sweating.
**The Crisis**: The SEC investigation. Conflict minerals. The lawsuit.

### Beat 4: The Accusation

Board Member (James):
> "Victor, the evidence points to your division."
> "You signed the procurement contracts."

Victor is calm.
> "I signed what you approved. Every document has your initials."

### Beat 5: The Betrayal

The Chairman (old, cold) speaks:
> "Victor. The company needs a face for this scandal."
> "You've served well. But we need someone to take the fall."
> "Sign the confession. We'll give you a golden parachute."

Victor stares.
> "You're sacrificing me."

The Chairman shrugs.
> "It's just business."

### Beat 6: Elena's Role

A young woman enters. **Elena Chen**.
Victor's protégé. He trained her.
She carries a folder.

> "Sorry, Victor. But if the company falls, 10,000 people lose jobs."
> "One man for 10,000. The math is simple."

She places the confession in front of him.
Victor looks at the faces around the table.
Not one ally.

**The Lesson**: Loyalty is a transaction. When the cost exceeds the value, it's terminated.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: Back to the Dungeon

Victor opens his eyes.
Sniv is still staring at him.
> "Boss? Boss eyes went far away."

Victor looks at his hands.
Different. Younger. Goblin-scratched.
But the hollow feeling is the same.

### Beat 8: The New Policy

Victor stands.
> "Sniv. New rule."
> "Loyalty is rewarded. Double rations for the original 14."
> "Disloyalty is punished. No warnings."

Sniv nods.
> "Boss is fair. Boss is strong."

Victor doesn't feel fair.
He feels like someone who just remembered why he stopped trusting people.

## Notes for Writing

- **Tone**: Cold. Corporate. Brutal without violence.
- **Contrast**: The sterile boardroom vs the dirty dungeon.
- **Elena**: Keep her ambiguous. Is she evil or pragmatic?
