# Outline: Chapter 56 - The Class Action

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

## Hook
Victor reviews the "Regulatory Threat Assessment". Inspector Vorne has filed for an "Emergency Injunction" to shut down Insolvia Holdings before Crown Prince Aldric arrives (now T-minus 71 hours). The argument: The dungeon is a "security risk" to the Royal Person. If granted, the Guild can legally seal the entrance.

## Development
### Beat 1: The Legal Defense
Victor holds an emergency board meeting.
- **Problem**: They cannot fight the Crown's authority. If the injunction passes, resisting is treason.
- **Asset**: Valerius (the corrupted Merchant Guild auditor) suggests a "Jurisdictional Challenge". If the dungeon is "Vital Economic Infrastructure," the Guild cannot close it without a public hearing.
- **Victor's Solution**: Weaponize the customer base. The adventurers *want* the dungeon open because it's the only fair leveling spot.

### Beat 2: Mobilizing the Assets
Victor initiates "Project Grassroots".
- Sniv is deployed to "leak" the closure news to the adventurers.
- The narrative: " The fat cats at the Guild want to close *your* gold mine."
- Victor drafts a "Class Action Petition" (signed by low-level adventurers) claiming the Guild is engaging in "Monopolistic Practices" by closing a competitor.
- He offers a "Signing Bonus" (1 free healing potion) for every adventurer who signs the petition.

### Beat 3: The Public Hearing (The Stunt)
Vorne tries to push the injunction at the Town Hall.
- He expects a quiet rubber-stamp from the Mayor.
- Instead, he finds hundreds of angry adventurers (Customers) clogging the square, waving Victor's placards ("My EXP, My Choice").
- Victor (via a proxy lawyer or Valerius) files the stack of petitions.
- The Mayor, fearing a riot before the Prince arrives, grants a "Temporary Stay of Enforcement" pending a full review (after the Prince's visit).

## Cliffhanger
The injunction is stalled, buying Victor time until the Prince arrives.
However, Vorne plays his trump card: If he can't close it legally, he will prove it's unsafe. He authorizes a "Level 10 Hazard Test" - a team of elite guild elites (The Crimson Blades) is sent to "stress test" the dungeon's safety measures.
**Status**: Hostile "Safety Inspectors" incoming.

## Checklist
- [ ] Victor uses law/crowds instead of force
- [ ] Sniv successfully manipulates adventurers
- [ ] "Class Action" terminology used appropriately
- [ ] Visual of adventurers protesting like a union
