# Outline: Chapter 2 - The First Contract

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 1,800 words
**Arc**: 1 (Dungeon)
**Position**: First recruitment, Sniv introduction

---

## Previously

Chapter 1 ended with Victor facing 12-15 goblins, offering to negotiate instead of fight.

---

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Standoff

The goblins freeze. This human isn't running. Isn't screaming. Isn't attacking.

He's *talking*.

Leader goblin (larger, scarred) doesn't understand. Prey doesn't negotiate. Prey dies.

**Victor observes** (Performance Review activates):

> **[PERFORMANCE REVIEW - Goblin Pack]**
> Units: 14
> Average Level: 3
> Threat Assessment: LETHAL (in aggregate)
> Notable: One unit significantly malnourished. Liability to pack.
> Recommendation: Identify weak link.

### Beat 2: Victor Identifies Sniv

At the back of the pack: one goblin smaller than the rest. Thin. Shaking. The others position themselves to shove him forward if things go wrong.

He's the sacrifice. The bait.

Victor's thought: *That one. He knows he's disposable. He'll listen.*

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Pitch

Victor addresses the pack leader directly:

> "I have a proposal. This dungeon's boss is dead—" (gestures at Marcus) "—and someone needs to manage this territory. I'm offering... employment."

Goblins don't understand "employment." They understand: food, territory, not-being-killed.

**ARMI translates**:

> Translation matrix active.
> "Employment" → "Food-giver position"
> "Territory" → "Safe sleep-place"
> "Contract" → "Promise-with-punishment"

### Beat 4: Leader's Rejection

The pack leader laughs (ugly, barking sound).

Why work for weak human? They'll kill human. Take shiny armor. Take glowing sword. Take everything.

He charges.

### Beat 5: Victor's Gamble

Victor doesn't move. No weapon. No magic. No chance.

But he has ONE asset: Marcus's backpack. The health potions.

He throws one at the charging leader.

Not AT him as a weapon—TO him. An offering.

Leader catches it reflexively. Stares. This is worth more than a week of hunting.

> "That's your signing bonus. There are four more. You want them? Then we talk. Or you can kill me and split one potion fourteen ways."

The math works. Even goblins can calculate: one potion vs employment with a strange human who gives away wealth.

### Beat 6: Negotiation

The pack hesitates. Leader looks at potion. Looks at Victor.

**ARMI notification**:
> Negotiation probability increased to 34%.

Victor pushes:

> "I know dungeons. I know how to make them profitable. More loot. More food. Less dying. But I need workers. You interested, or should I find smarter goblins?"

The insult lands. Goblins have pride—primitive, but real.

### Beat 7: Sniv Steps Forward

From the back, a small voice:

> "Sniv will work."

The other goblins turn. The runt spoke. The sacrifice volunteered.

Leader snarls. Weakness! Betrayal!

But Sniv sees what the others don't: This human is OFFERING. No one has ever offered Sniv anything except death.

**ARMI notification**:
> Employee application received.
> Candidate: Sniv (Goblin, Lv 1)
> Skills: Counting (basic), Servility (advanced), Survival instinct (extreme)
> Assessment: Suitable for entry-level position.

### Beat 8: The Split

Victor addresses Sniv directly:

> "You're in. As of now, you work for me. That means the pack can't touch you without my permission."

To the leader:

> "Your choice. Join, and I'll make this pack the wealthiest in the dungeon. Refuse, and I leave with your... former member. Good luck explaining that to your crew."

**Goblin psychology**: A leader who loses members is weak. Questions arise. Challenges happen.

The pack leader cannot afford to look weak.

### Beat 9: Conditional Agreement

Leader agrees—temporarily. Probation. Trial period. (He doesn't know those words, but Victor establishes the concept.)

**Contract terms**:
- Goblins get regular food (from dungeon's supply)
- Goblins follow Victor's orders
- First betrayal = termination (they think this means death. Victor means something worse.)

**ARMI notification**:
> **[HOSTILE TAKEOVER - PARTIAL]**
> Entities acquired: 14 (provisional)
> Loyalty status: UNSTABLE
> Cost: 4 Health Potions (200 GP equivalent)
> Note: Investment requires maintenance.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 10: Sniv's Question

As the pack disperses to explore the boss chamber, Sniv lingers near Victor.

> "Boss... Boss give Sniv food?"

Victor looks at the small goblin. Three days from starvation. Pathetic. Desperate.

Also: the only creature in this dungeon who chose him freely.

He hands Sniv a ration from Marcus's pack.

> "Eat. Then we work. I need you functional."

Sniv devours the ration. For the first time in his life, someone gave him food without demanding he fight for it first.

**ARMI notification**:
> Employee loyalty increased.
> Sniv: UNSTABLE → CONDITIONAL

### Beat 11: The Problem

Victor surveys the boss chamber. Fourteen new employees. Zero infrastructure. No income stream yet.

And somewhere deeper in the dungeon... something else lives.

The pack leader mentions casually:

> "We not go deep floors. Big thing there. Eats goblins."

**ARMI query**:
> Entity detected: Floor 4 guardian.
> Classification: Boss-class (Minotaur variant)
> Threat level: EXTREME
> Recommendation: Avoid engagement until resources permit.

Victor looks toward the deeper tunnels.

> *Another middle manager. Eventually, I'll have to deal with him too.*

### Beat 12: Chapter End

Victor turns to Sniv.

> "First assignment. I need a headcount of every creature on floors one through three. Names, if they have them. Skills, if you can observe any. Report back in four hours."

Sniv blinks. Someone just gave him a *task*. A real task. Not "die for us" or "run first into the trap."

> "Sniv... Sniv do this. Sniv do good job. Boss will see."

He scurries off. The first employee. The first believer.

---

## Chapter End Hook

Victor has 14 provisional goblins. One actually loyal.

A starving workforce. Zero capital. No weapons. And a boss monster lurking below.

But he has something he didn't have an hour ago: *human resources*.

Now he needs to make them productive.
