## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Archive Interface

Victor activates the crystal archive.

A holographic interface materializes—ancient but functional.

**Archive Contents**:
> - Personal Logs: 847 entries
> - Consortium Protocols: 12 documents
> - World Assessment: Terra-Insolvia
> - [ENCRYPTED]: 3 files

Nova: "THIS TECHNOLOGY IS... SUPERIOR TO MY OWN. RESTRUCTURER #1 HAD ACCESS I DO NOT."

### Beat 2: The First Log

Victor opens the first entry:

> *"Day 1. Arrival confirmed. The Consortium chose this world for... restructuring. Population: 2.3 million. Resources: Moderate. Mana density: High. My assessment: Salvageable, if managed correctly."*

Victor: "Two million people. And they sent one manager."

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Logs

Victor reads selectively:

**Log #47**: *"The natives are primitive but adaptable. I've introduced basic economic systems. Currency replaces barter. Efficiency improves."*

**Log #203**: *"The Consortium demands faster returns. They don't understand—sustainable growth requires patience. I've requested extension."*

**Log #412**: *"Request denied. They want... liquidation metrics. I don't recognize this protocol."*

### Beat 4: The Warning

**Log #659**: *"I understand now. 'Restructuring' is their word for harvest. They strip worlds of mana, resources, souls—then move on. Terra-Insolvia is scheduled for 'Final Processing' in 500 years."*

Victor calculates. That was 2,000 years ago.

**Log #712**: *"I've hidden the processing codes. Without them, the Consortium cannot initiate Final Processing remotely. They'll have to send someone."*

**Log #847** (Final): *"I am dying. The Consortium tried to terminate me when I refused orders. I've built this vault to warn whoever comes next. If you're reading this: The black card is your only leverage. Use it wisely. -R#1"*

### Beat 5: The Timeline

Victor processes:
- Final Processing scheduled: 1,500 years ago (already past)
- But Terra-Insolvia still exists
- R#1 hid the codes
- The Consortium has been waiting for a new Restructurer to find them

Victor: "They sent me because they need someone on the ground to finish what #1 refused to do."

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 6: The Encrypted Files

Victor attempts to access the encrypted files.

**ARMI Alert**:
> Decryption Requires: Restructurer Clearance Level 5
> Current Level: 1
> Action: Denied

He needs to level up his Restructurer authority to access the final secrets.

### Beat 7: The Card's Purpose

Victor examines the black card again.

**ARMI Analysis**:
> Asset Transfer Notice
> Contents: Authority Upgrade Token
> Effect: Grants +1 Restructurer Level
> Condition: Claim at designated Consortium waypoint
> Nearest Waypoint: Oakhaven (City - 3 days travel)

The card is an upgrade. But claiming it means going to the city.

Going to the city means leaving the dungeon.

Leaving the dungeon means exposure.

Victor: "Nova. Can you defend this place without me for a week?"

Nova: "AFFIRMATIVE. BUT WHO WILL YOU TAKE?"

Victor looks at his org chart.

> "Sniv runs operations. Asterion defends. Krog stays. I need someone small, quiet, and expendable who can navigate a city."

Zip raises a claw: "Zip go?"

Victor: "Zip goes."

## Checklist

- [x] **Milestone**: R#1's full history revealed
- [x] **Lore**: Consortium's "Final Processing" explained
- [x] **Plot Setup**: Victor must go to Oakhaven
- [x] **Mechanism**: Restructurer levels, authority upgrades
- [x] **Party Formation**: Victor + Zip = city expedition

## Notes for Writing

- **The Logs**: Brief excerpts. Don't read all 847.
- **R#1's Voice**: Professional, then desperate. Mirror of Victor's potential future.
- **The Card**: Elegant plot device. Upgrades require risk.
- **Zip Goes**: Comedy setup. Kobold in a city = chaos.
