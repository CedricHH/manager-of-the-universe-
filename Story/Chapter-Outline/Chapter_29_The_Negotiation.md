## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: First Contact

The Iron Wolves reach the "trap corridor."

Instead of traps activating, a goblin steps out. Sniv. Holding a clipboard.

> "Welcome to Insolvia Holdings. Entry fee: 5 GP per person. Sign waiver."

Gareth (leader): "What the—"

Mira (mage): "...Is that goblin offering us paperwork?"

### Beat 2: The Confusion

The party freezes. This isn't how dungeons work.

Gareth: "Kill it."

Bron raises his shield. Tessa hesitates.

Sniv, unfazed: "Killing staff voids liability waiver. All loot rights forfeited. Please reconsider."

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Offer

Victor's voice echoes through the corridor (via Core's speaker system):

> "Adventurers. I'm offering you a deal. Pay the entry fee, navigate the dungeon, keep 100% of loot. No Guild cut. No registration. No questions."

Mira: "Who are you?"

Victor: "The Manager."

### Beat 4: The Negotiation

Gareth wants to fight. Mira wants information.

Victor sweetens the deal:
- Floor 1-3: Standard challenge, fair loot
- Floor 4: Optional boss fight (Asterion), premium rewards
- Death insurance: 50 GP refund to next of kin if killed

Mira: "You're... monetizing the dungeon?"

Victor: "I'm optimizing it. Your choice: pay and play, or leave."

### Beat 5: The Split

Gareth: "We don't negotiate with monsters."

Mira: "We don't usually encounter monsters with accounting degrees either."

Tessa (young rogue): "I vote we pay. This is... interesting."

Bron: Silent. Shrugs.

**Decision**: 3-1. They pay 20 GP entry fee.

## FLASHBACK: Discovery of the Truth (Continued)

### The Investigation

Victor couldn't stop looking at the photos.

He was a corporate shark. He'd laid off thousands. But children?

He began digging. Used old contacts. Called in favors.

The evidence multiplied:
- Board meeting minutes (they knew)
- Supplier contracts (Victor's signature, but above his clearance)
- Shipping manifests (conflict zone origins hidden)

### The Realization

Victor's infamous "efficiency protocols" hadn't just optimized supply chains.

They'd **accelerated demand** for materials that came from mines where children died.

He'd never asked. That was the crime.

Not active evil. Passive blindness. The spreadsheet didn't have a column for "human cost."

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Present: Floor 2

The Iron Wolves advance through the Fungal Gardens.

Sniv guides them. Points out "optional challenge areas" (with extra loot for extra risk).

Mira: "This is... actually well-designed."

Gareth: "It's a trap."

Victor (via speaker): "Of course it's a trap. All dungeons are traps. The question is: whose trap benefits you more? Mine, or the Guild's 20% cut?"

### The Counter-Offer

Mira makes an offer:

> "What if we become... repeat customers? Discount rate?"

Victor pauses.

This is new. Adventurers asking for a subscription model.

> "10% discount for return visits. 15% if you bring referrals."

Gareth: "This is insane."

Tessa: "This is brilliant."

**Profit so far**: 20 GP entry fee
**Target**: 22.5 GP (50% increase)
**Current Status**: Already at 133% of baseline. And they haven't reached Floor 3 yet.

- [x] **Flashback**: Victor's investigation deepens
- [x] **Innovation**: Subscription model proposed by adventurers
- [x] **Profit Update**: Target already exceeded

## Notes for Writing

- **Mira**: The reasonable one. She's the crack in "kill all monsters" mentality.
- **Tessa**: Young, adaptable. Represents next-gen adventurer thinking.
- **Gareth**: Stuck in old ways. Comic foil.
- **Flashback Tone**: Cold, clinical. Victor examining his sins like data.

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
**Next Chapter**: Chapter 30 - The Partnership (Flashback concludes, Core deal sealed)
