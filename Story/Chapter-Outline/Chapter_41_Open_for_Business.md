# Outline: Chapter 41 - Open for Business

**Word Target**: 1500-2000

## Hook
The morning after the fire. The market square is charred, smelling of smoke and ruin. In the middle of the destruction, Victor sets up his stall. The visual contrast is striking: chaos and ash surrounding a pristine, organized point of sale. Zip is nervous, twitching at every shadow. Kael and Mira stand guard, visible and armed—a statement of force and legitimacy.

## Development
### Beat 1: The Market Response
The crowd gathers. They are angry at the Cartel (blamed for the fire due to Victor's rumors/evidence) but desperate for potions.
Victor opens shop. "Disaster Relief Pricing" - 5 GP.
The sales are explosive. It's not just a transaction; it's a protest vote by the people against the monopoly.
Victor analyzes the "Market Sentiment" metrics via ARMI.

### Beat 2: Bureaucratic Warfare
A City Inspector arrives, clearly on the Cartel's payroll. He attempts to shut down the stall for "Safety Violations" or "Zoning Infractions due to Fire Damage."
Victor doesn't argue effectively; he argues legally. He produces the Merchant Guild documents signed in Chapter 40.
"This area is under Merchant Guild emergency jurisdiction."
The Inspector is outranked and retreats, but the malice in his eyes promises violence.

### Beat 3: The Violent Option
Subtle intimidation fails. Brute force follows.
"Bandits" (Cartel enforcers out of uniform) attempt to raid the stall/stock.
Kael intercepts them. He announces loudly: "I am contracted by the Merchant Guild. Striking me is an act of war against the Council."
The enforcers hesitate but attack.
The fight is short. Mira's magic exposes them or disables them efficiently. Victor ensures the crowd sees it as "The Cartel attacking the people's supply."

## Cliffhanger
The stock is sold out. The message has been sent.
A courier arrives—not a thug, but a high-level servant.
He delivers a letter on black parchment with gold ink.
From Guildmaster Groll.
"You have my attention, Mr. Kaine. Dinner. Tonight."
The invitation is a summons.

## Checklist
- [ ] Victor leverages the previous chapter's Guild protection
- [ ] Public sentiment turns further against the Cartel
- [ ] Kael and Mira demonstrate competence
- [ ] Cliffhanger raises the stakes to the boss level (Groll)
