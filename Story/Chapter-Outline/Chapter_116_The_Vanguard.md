## Hook (250-350 words)

**Opening**: Pre-dawn. Victor on Ironhold walls with Resh. Coalition mercenaries arriving—4,000 soldiers filing into defensive positions. They look professional but *disengaged*. These are contract fighters, not believers.

**Key Elements**:
- Mercenary captain (Captain Riven) reports to Victor—not Dravik. Coalition command structure unclear.
- Dravik's 130 remaining Warlord troops are battle-tested but exhausted.
- Victor realizes: he's commanding an army that doesn't recognize his authority.
- Revolutionary vanguard dust visible on horizon (12 hours out).

**Hook**: "They'll fight for gold. But will they *die* for gold? That's the question."

## Development (1,100-1,400 words)

### Beat 1: Command Structure Crisis (~400 words)
**The Problem**: Three separate forces—Warlords, Valorian Mercenaries, Morthane Mercenaries—with no unified command structure.

**Dravik's position**: "My soldiers follow me. The mercenaries follow gold. No one follows *you*."

**Victor's solution**: Doesn't demand command. Instead, creates *coordination protocol*.
- Each force maintains internal command
- Victor serves as "Tactical Liaison"—provides recommendations, not orders
- ARMI serves as real-time battlefield intelligence network
- Forces coordinate through Victor, not under Victor

**Dravik's approval**: "Clever. You command without appearing to command."

**Captain Riven's skepticism**: "And if your 'recommendations' get my soldiers killed?"

**Victor**: "Then my recommendations were wrong, and you should ignore them. I'm not here to lead. I'm here to *optimize*."

### Beat 2: Preparation Phase (~400 words)
**Defensive optimization**: Victor walks the walls with Sera and Resh.

**Key improvements**:
- Artillery placement optimized for overlapping fire zones
- Kill zones established at three approach routes
- Fall-back positions pre-designated (reducing chaos if walls breach)
- Medical staging areas established (casualty processing efficiency)

**Resh's combat assessment**: "Revolutionary vanguard is probe force. They'll test walls, find weakness, report back to main army. If we crush them decisively, main army hesitates. If we barely hold, they attack immediately."

**Victor's strategy**: "Then we don't just win. We win *expensively*. For them."

**ARMI tactical display**: Revolutionary vanguard composition:
- 3,000 infantry (Levels 5-9)
- 1,500 mages (support/artillery)
- 500 cavalry (flanking specialists)
- Command unit: Sub-Tribune Aldric Thorne (Level 15)

### Beat 3: The Engagement (~400 words)
**Battle begins**: Revolutionary vanguard assaults northern approach.

**Key combat beats**:
- First wave repelled by coordinated fire (Victor's kill zone placement works)
- Revolutionary mages unleash artillery barrage—walls hold (Morthane engineers reinforced overnight)
- Cavalry flanking attempt detected by Sera's scrying—mercenary reserves redeploy to intercept
- Victor's "recommendations" prove accurate—Captain Riven starts following without questioning

**Crisis moment**: Sub-Tribune Thorne personally leads assault on eastern gate. Level 15 commander cutting through mercenary lines.

**Resh deployment**: Victor: "Resh, eastern gate needs Executive Intervention."

Resh's response: Draws weapons. Moves. 

**Combat showcase**: Resh vs Thorne. Level 18 vs Level 15. Not close. Thorne lasts 23 seconds—respectable, but not enough. Resh takes Thorne's command insignia.

**Revolutionary withdrawal**: Vanguard breaks. 2,100 casualties. Coalition: 340.

## Cliffhanger (250-350 words)

**Aftermath**: Dawn. Smoke clearing. Victor surveys battlefield with the mercenary captain.

**Captain Riven's shift**: "Your recommendations were... effective. The eastern gate call saved 200 of my soldiers."

**Victor**: "I told you—I optimize. Your soldiers surviving is optimal."

**Riven's concession**: Informal command authority established. Mercenaries will follow Victor's tactical recommendations.

**ARMI update**:
> **[ARMI: ENGAGEMENT REPORT]**
> Vanguard Status: DEFEATED
> Coalition Casualties: 340 (8.5%)
> Revolutionary Casualties: 2,100 (42%)
> Command Kill: Sub-Tribune Aldric Thorne (eliminated)
> Assessment: DECISIVE VICTORY

**Complication**: Sera intercepts Revolutionary response.

> **[SERA: INTERCEPT]**
> Source: Tribune Vex Command Post
> Content: "Vanguard destroyed. Adjust main assault: full commitment. Total siege. No probing. 36-hour deployment."

**CLIFFHANGER**: Victor proved the coalition can fight together—but now Vex isn't testing. He's coming with everything.

**Final ARMI Message**:
> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 4, HOUR 2]**
> **[REVOLUTIONARY MAIN ARMY: 36 HOURS]**
> **[COALITION COHESION: IMPROVING]**
> **[MISSION CLOCK: 116 DAYS, 17 HOURS REMAINING]**

**Resh**: Combat showcase. Demonstrates why Tier 4 operatives are strategic assets.

**Captain Riven**: Skeptic turned believer. Represents mercenary faction buy-in.

**Sera**: Intelligence enabler. Detects flanking attempt, intercepts Vex response.

**Dravik**: Supports Victor's coordination approach. Partnership deepening.

## Thematic Notes

Leadership isn't about giving orders—it's about creating systems where the right decisions get made. Victor doesn't need to be a general; he needs to be the *most useful person in the room*.

**Key Line**: "I don't give orders. I provide recommendations that happen to be correct."
