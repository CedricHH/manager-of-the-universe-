# Outline: Chapter 85 - The Decompression Protocol

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000

## Hook
Malphas slams his hand onto a floating podium, triggering the initial sequence of Clause 44-B. The mana-lights in the garden flicker and turn a warning crimson. The ground trembles as the mana-stabilizers in the Grey Spires (miles away) begin to destabilize. The guests panic. Malphas laughs, believing he has forced a stalemate.

## Development

### Beat 1: The Panic Selling
Victor ignores the physical tremors and focuses on the ARMI ticker. He orders Silas (via earpiece/comms) to "dump the secondary derivatives." Malphas is confused. Victor explains that Clause 44-B is contractually linked to the *ownership* of the mine. If Malphas doesn't own the mine, he can't blow it up.

### Beat 2: The Hostile Transfer
Mina executes a "Flash-Crash Acquisition." Victor uses the `[Hostile Takeover]` skill (costing significant gold) to force-buy the debt *during* the seconds of the explosion sequence. He buys the Grey Spires for pennies as they are "exploding"—which technically makes them *his* exploding asset.

### Beat 3: The Decompression
Now the owner, Victor uses `[Asset Liquidation]` not to sell the mine, but to "liquidate" the excess mana pressure. He converts the building mana-explosion into pure currency/mana points, venting the "volatility" into his own account. The explosion fizzles out into a shower of harmless golden sparks (or digital coins). Malphas is left holding a detonator to a bomb he no longer owns.

## Cliffhanger
Malphas is arrested by Thaddeus Vane (or Imperial Guards) for "attempted destruction of Imperial property" (since the mine is now Victor's/Empire's). As he is dragged away, Hestia approaches Victor. She isn't angry; she's impressed. She offers him a new "portfolio"—a much more dangerous assignment.

## Checklist
- [ ] Protagonist demonstrates competence (Converting an explosion into profit)
- [ ] Genre-specific elements present (Flash-Crash, Hostile Takeover)
- [ ] Cliffhanger creates urgency (Hestia's next move)
- [ ] 2+ ARMI system messages
