---

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Aftermath of Adrenaline

The goblins disperse. The immediate crisis is over.
Victor finds himself alone in the Boss Chamber. His hands are shaking.

**Physical state**: He hasn't eaten. He hasn't slept. He almost died twice.
**Mental state**: The survival instincts fade. The questions return.

> "Where am I? What happened to me?"

### Beat 2: Taking Stock

Victor looks around the chamber:
- Stone walls, ancient
- Marcus's corpse (now just bones after goblin... processing)
- A broken throne
- Dust

He needs order. He starts cleaning. Compulsively.
> *Chaos is inefficient. Start with a workspace.*

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Stone Desk

Victor drags a flat stone to the center.
He arranges Marcus's remaining items:
- The glowing sword (still soulbound/useless)
- The empty backpack
- The map
- 1 remaining ration

He sits on the broken throne. It's uncomfortable.
But it's **his**.

### Beat 4: ARMI Deep Dive

Victor opens the ARMI interface properly for the first time.
Not in panic mode. In **Analysis** mode.

**What he learns**:
- His HP: 50 (Low for this world)
- His GP: 0 (Dangerous)
- Skills Available: [Performance Review] (Free)
- Skills Locked: Many (Require Capital)

**Key Discovery**:
> "Gold equals Mana. I'm not just broke—I'm *powerless*."

### Beat 5: The Flashback Trigger

Victor stares at his reflection in the sword's blade.
The face is younger. Different. But the eyes...

**Memory Fragment**:
A boardroom. Glass walls. Rain outside.
A spreadsheet. A severance package. A voice saying: "It's just business, Victor."

He blinks. The dungeon returns.

> "I was a manager. On Earth. I..."

The memory slips away. Like water through fingers.
**ARMI Note**: `[Memory Module: Fragmented. Recovery in progress.]`

### Beat 6: The Survival Priority

Victor shakes off the confusion.
He can't afford to dwell on the past. Not yet.

**Immediate Problems**:
1. 14 goblins need food (he has 1 ration)
2. He has 0 gold (no skills)
3. Something dangerous is below (Floor 4)

He writes a list on the dusty floor with a bone:
> 1. Food
> 2. Gold
> 3. Defenses

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: Sniv Returns

Sniv bursts in, breathless.
He has scratches on his face. His "counting mission" was dangerous.

He holds a crude tally:
> "Boss! Sniv count! Floor 1-3!"
> "Goblins: 28 more (hostile)"
> "Rats: Many"
> "Slimes: Infinite (Floor 2)"
> "Big Scary: Floor 4 (No go)"

**Victor's Assessment**:
- More goblins = potential recruits or threats
- Rats = protein
- Slimes = resource?
- Floor 4 = Boss Monster (Avoid for now)

### Beat 8: The Food Crisis

Sniv adds quietly:
> "Also... Pack hungry. Looking at Sniv. Hungry eyes."

Victor checks the time (mental estimation).
They've been awake for ~8 hours.
The health potions are gone (eaten for the sugar).
The one ration won't feed 15 creatures.

**Deadline**: Find food in the next 4 hours, or the "contract" dissolves into cannibalism.

Victor stands.
> "Show me Floor 2. The slimes."

## Notes for Writing

- **Tone**: Quiet. Introspective. The calm before the next storm.
- **Victor's Voice**: He's not panicking, but he's unsettled. The memories are scratching at the surface.
- **Foreshadowing**: The "boardroom" and "severance" memories hint at the Betrayal without revealing it.
