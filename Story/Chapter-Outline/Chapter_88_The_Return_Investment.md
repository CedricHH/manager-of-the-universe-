# Outline: Chapter 88 - The Return Investment [WRITTEN]

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000

## Hook
- **Setting**: Imperial Highway (blocked by Barnaby's wagon).
- **Action**: Negotiation phase. Barnaby is trying to charge an "Avalanche Bypass Premium."
- **Victor's Analysis**: The "Avalanche" looks suspicious. The snow pile is too neat. It's artificial scarcity.

## Development
### Beat 1: The Due Diligence
- Victor sends Sniv (implied presence) or uses ARMI to scan the "obstruction."
- Discovery: The avalanche is an illusion or a created construct (earth magic).
- Victor confronts Barnaby with fraud charges vs. legitimate commerce.

### Beat 2: The Hostile Takeover
- Duel of Commerce: Barnaby uses `[Price Gouging]` (Psychic attack - induce poverty anxiety).
- Victor counters with `[Asset Liquidation]`. He doesn't attack Barnaby; he attacks Barnaby's *business license*.
- Victor identifies that Barnaby's wagon is actually a "Mobile Pocket Dimension" (Rare Asset) stolen from a supply guild.
- Victor "forecloses" on the wagon as payment for not reporting Barnaby to Hestia/Vane.

### Beat 3: The Upgrade
- Victor acquires the **Gilded Caravan**.
- Features: It's bigger on the inside. Luxury office + Cargo hold.
- Victor hires Barnaby (reluctantly) as "Head of Logistics" because Barnaby knows the secret routes.
- **The Journey Accelerates**: The wagon is much faster than the rental carriage.

## Cliffhanger
- They are speeding south.
- ARMI Alert: [Galactic Exchange] is fully online.
- First listing appears: A "Distressed Divinity" selling miracles for quick cash.
- Victor realizes: He can trade with *other* worlds.
- **Goal Check**: 29 Days remaining. 64,230 GP / 1,000,000 GP.

## Checklist
- [ ] Victor demonstrates competence (Market analysis, negotiation)
- [ ] New Asset acquired (The Gilded Caravan)
- [ ] Barnaby recruited (or enslaved via contract)
- [ ] Galactic Exchange mechanic introduced
