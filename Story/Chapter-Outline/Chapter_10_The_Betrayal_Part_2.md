## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Iron Problem

Victor examines the iron deposit.
Good news: Material for better weapons.
Bad news: No one knows how to forge.

He assigns the strongest goblins to mining.
> "Dig. Stack. Don't die."

### Beat 2: The Scroll Again

Victor re-reads Sir Kael's warning.
> "The beast cannot be killed."

Not "is very strong." Cannot be killed.
Is Asterion immortal? Or is there a trick?

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: FLASHBACK - The Aftermath (2 Years Ago)

**Trigger**: The phrase "I have failed" echoes.
Victor failed too. After the betrayal.

**Setting**: Victor's apartment. Empty. Expensive.
He sits in the dark. Hasn't shaved in weeks.
The TV plays news about the scandal.
> "Former executive Victor Kaine has been named the sole defendant..."

### Beat 4: The Emptiness

Victor doesn't feel angry anymore.
He feels **nothing**.
The betrayal hollowed him out.

He looks at the whiskey. The pills. The balcony.
**Option 1**: End it.
**Option 2**: ???

He doesn't know what Option 2 is yet.

### Beat 5: The File

A knock at the door.
A delivery.
An envelope with no return address.

Inside: A USB drive.
And a note: "You were right. Here's proof. - S."

**S = Sarah?** The woman from the earlier dream?
Victor's hands shake.

### Beat 6: Back to the Dungeon

Victor snaps back.
Sniv is staring at him again.
> "Boss goes away in head a lot. Is sickness?"

Victor stands.
> "It's memory, Sniv. Old wounds."
> Sniv: "Sniv has old wounds. They heal. Boss heals too."

Victor almost smiles.
> "Maybe."

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Rumble

The ground shakes.
Not like last time (distant).
This time: **Close**.

### Beat 8: The Messenger

A goblin runs in, screaming.
> "Cow-man! Cow-man send messenger!"

A small creature (an imp?) flies into the chamber.
It lands on Victor's desk.
It speaks in a deep, echoing voice:
> "The Master of Floor 4 demands tribute."
> "Food. Wealth. Or souls."
> "You have 3 days."

The imp vanishes.

Victor looks at the stairs to Floor 4.
Asterion isn't just a threat anymore.
He's a **creditor**.

## Checklist

- [x] **Flashback**: Victor's depression post-betrayal
- [x] **Mystery**: Sarah and the USB drive (Setup for later)
- [x] **Plot**: Asterion demands tribute
- [x] **Pacing**: Tension escalates

---

## Notes for Writing

- **Flashback**: Keep it dark but not suicidal. Victor is empty, not dying.
- **Sarah**: Don't reveal who she is yet. Plant the seed.
- **Asterion**: He's not attacking. He's negotiating. Boss-level play.
