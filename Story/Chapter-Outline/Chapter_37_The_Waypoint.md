Chapter 36 ended with:

- Legitimate permits acquired
- Victor heading toward Oakhaven proper
- Consortium waypoint still ahead
- Zip in bag, learning professionalism

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Oakhaven Entry

Victor enters the city proper.

**First Impressions**:
- Larger than expected (10,000+ population)
- Active marketplace, guild halls, merchant quarter
- Professional infrastructure (maintained roads, functioning sewers)
- ARMI Assessment: "Viable commercial ecosystem"

### Beat 2: The Waypoint Location

Victor asks directions (merchant quarter innkeeper).

Innkeeper: "The old Consortium office? Yeah, abandoned building on Temple Street. Nobody uses it anymore. Consortium hasn't had operations here in... century? Maybe more."

Victor notes: Consortium presence historical, not active.

Opportunity or trap?

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Abandoned Office

Victor finds the building.

**Description**:
- Three-story stone structure
- Faded Consortium markings (same symbols as black card)
- Heavy dust, no recent foot traffic
- But: Door unlocks to black card proximity

Victor: "Automated systems. Still functional after centuries."

### Beat 4: The Activation Chamber

Inside: Reception hall with central pedestal.

**ARMI scans**:
> Environmental Scan: Magical infrastructure active
> Warning: External monitoring detected
> Recommendation: Card activation will transmit location data

Victor acknowledges risk. He needs the authority upgrade.

He places the black card on the pedestal.

### Beat 5: The Upgrade

Light flares. Holographic interface activates.

> **[CONSORTIUM WAYPOINT - ACTIVE]**
> Identity: Restructurer #8940 (Victor Kaine)
> Current Level: 1
> Authorization Token Detected: Priority Asset Transfer Notice
> Processing upgrade...
> 
> UPGRADE COMPLETE
> New Level: 2
> Access Granted: Extended ARMI Functions
> Access Granted: Encrypted Archive (Partial - Files 1-2 of 3)
> 
> STATUS REPORT TRANSMITTED
> Current Location: Oakhaven, Valdris Kingdom
> Dungeon Status: Operational (Tutorial Dungeon #447)
> Revenue Performance: +340% baseline
> Assessment: EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS
> 
> MESSAGE FROM CONSORTIUM:
> "Continue operations. Quarterly audit scheduled: 90 days."

Victor absorbs this.

90 days until direct Consortium oversight.

### Beat 6: The New Functions

Victor tests upgraded ARMI:

**New Capabilities**:
- Longer range environmental scans
- Detailed financial projections
- Contract binding authority increased
- [Asset Liquidation] skill unlocked (convert targets to GP directly)

**Encrypted Files Unlocked** (2 of 3):
- File 1: "Restructurer Protocol Manual"
- File 2: "Terra-Insolvia Economic History" 
- File 3: Still locked (requires Level 5)

Victor reads File 1 overview: Standard Consortium operations, harvest preparation timelines, population management guidelines.

Exactly what he expected. And exactly what he's NOT doing.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Watcher

Victor exits the waypoint building.

Someone's watching.

Not hostile. Not obviously threatening. But professional surveillance.

Victor's upgraded ARMI identifies:
> Target: Unknown humanoid
> Level: 15-18 (estimated)
> Affiliation: Unknown
> Threat Assessment: Monitoring, not engaging

Victor doesn't confront. Walks calmly toward the merchant quarter.

The watcher doesn't follow—but Victor knows: someone in Oakhaven just became very interested in the man who activated a dead Consortium waypoint.

### Beat 8: Zip's Observation

From the bag: "Zip detect... someone watching?"

Victor: "Yes."

Zip: "Bad watching or... curious watching?"

Victor: "Information gathering. Someone wants to know who I am before making contact."

Zip: "What Zip do?"

Victor: "Stay quiet. Stay ready. And remember—we're merchants. Just merchants with very good institutional connections."

Victor heads toward the merchant district inn Sterling recommended.

Behind him, the waypoint building goes dark again.

And somewhere in Oakhaven, a report is being written about the stranger who brought a century-dead Consortium office back to life.
