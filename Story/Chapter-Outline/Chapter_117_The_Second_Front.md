## Hook (250-350 words)

**Opening**: Victor in Dravik's war room. Maps spread across table showing Revolutionary army positions. 25,000 troops, 32 hours out. Even with 4,000 mercenaries, the math doesn't work.

**Key Elements**:
- Coalition forces now at 4,130 (130 Warlords + 4,000 mercenaries)
- Revolutionary advantage: 6:1 ratio
- Ironhold can't survive sustained siege—supplies last 31 days, but walls won't
- Victor needs more allies—fast

**Hook**: "We can't win this battle. So we change the battlefield."

**Victor's proposal**: Contact remaining factions. Force Revolutionary army to defend *their* territory.

## Development (1,100-1,400 words)

### Beat 1: The Strategic Pivot (~400 words)
**Victor's analysis**: Revolutionaries are overextending. All 25,000 troops moving to Ironhold means their supply lines and rear territories are exposed.

**ARMI tactical projection**:
- Revolutionary capital: Solvara East District (administrative center)
- Supply depot: Thornfield Junction (3 days supplies if captured)
- Communication hub: Tower of the People (magical relay network)

**Strategy**: "If Legitimists attack Thornfield Junction and Theocrats threaten Solvara East, Vex has to split his army. We don't need to win every front—we need him to lose momentum."

**Dravik's objection**: "Legitimists won't fight for a Warlord. Theocrats hate everyone."

**Victor**: "They won't fight for us. They'll fight for *their own objectives*. We just align the timing."

### Beat 2: Contacting the Legitimists (~400 words)
**Approach**: Victor uses Consortium credentials to request audience with Princess Celestia (Legitimist faction leader).

**Sera's intelligence briefing** (Princess Celestia):
- Last surviving royal heir (17 years old)
- Controls 4,000 troops (loyal to throne)
- Currently defending Royal Palace ruins (northern territory)
- Objective: Restore monarchy, reclaim Bank for "legitimate government"

**Message sent via Consortium channel**:
> "Princess Celestia: The Consortium proposes coordinated action. Revolutionary Army exposed at Thornfield Junction. Your forces could capture critical supply depot, weaken Revolutionary offensive, and recover royal assets stored at depot. 48-hour window."

**Response** (2 hours later):
> "Consortium agent: The Crown does not coordinate with thieves and vultures. However, if Revolutionary supply lines happen to be vulnerable, the Crown would act in its own interest. Timing... coincidental."

**Victor's interpretation**: She'll attack—but won't formally ally. Plausible deniability. Good enough.

### Beat 3: The Theocrat Gambit (~400 words)
**The problem**: Theocrats (Church Remnant) are the most ideologically opposed to Consortium involvement.

**Sera's intelligence briefing** (Theocrat Faction):
- Led by High Priest Mordecai (former Church inquisitor)
- 8,000 militants (religious zealots)
- Currently holding Cathedral District (sacred ground)
- Objective: "Purify" Terra-Solvaris of both Revolutionary atheism AND Consortium "foreign corruption"

**Victor's angle**: Can't appeal to profit. Must appeal to *doctrine*.

**Message sent**:
> "High Priest Mordecai: The Revolutionary Army has desecrated Temple of the Four Winds (conquered territory). Sacred relics held in Revolutionary capital. Consortium offers intelligence on relic locations in exchange for... nothing. Consider it a donation."

**Mordecai's response** (4 hours later):
> "The Church requires no pagan's charity. But desecration demands purification. Send the intelligence. We will... act as doctrine requires."

**Victor's interpretation**: Theocrats will attack Solvara East to recover relics. Timing aligned. No formal alliance—but converging objectives.

## Cliffhanger (250-350 words)

**Strategic overview**: Three fronts now active.

**ARMI update**:
> **[ARMI: MULTI-FRONT ASSESSMENT]**
> Front 1 (Ironhold): Revolutionary main army, 32 hours
> Front 2 (Thornfield): Legitimist attack, 28 hours (projected)
> Front 3 (Solvara East): Theocrat assault, 26 hours (projected)
> Assessment: Revolutionary splitting LIKELY

**Dravik's reaction**: "You created a war. Not an alliance."

**Victor**: "Alliances require trust. War requires *opportunity*. They'll fight because it benefits them, not because they trust us."

**COMPLICATION**: Sera detects internal communication.

> **[SERA: INTERCEPT]**
> Source: House Kieran (Merchant Coalition)
> Destination: Revolutionary Command
> Content: "Coalition forces concentrated at Ironhold. Eastern approach undermanned. Attack window: 30 hours."

**CLIFFHANGER**: Kieran is betraying them. The Revolutionaries know exactly where the defenses are weak.

**Final ARMI Message**:
> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 4, HOUR 18]**
> **[MULTI-FRONT OPERATION: INITIATED]**
> **[BETRAYAL DETECTED: HOUSE KIERAN]**
> **[MISSION CLOCK: 116 DAYS, 1 HOUR REMAINING]**

## Key Character Notes

**Victor**: Masterful manipulation of faction self-interest. Doesn't need alliances—needs converging opportunities.

**Princess Celestia**: Proud, young, pragmatic despite ideology. Won't ally but will act.

**High Priest Mordecai**: Religious fanatic, but predictable. Victor uses doctrine as leverage.

**Sera**: Detects Kieran betrayal. Critical intelligence saves operation.

---

## Thematic Notes

Victor orchestrates a war without commanding armies. He provides information and timing—factions act in their own interest, but the aggregate effect serves Victor's goals. This is "market manipulation" applied to warfare.

**Key Line**: "I don't need allies. I need participants who profit from the same outcome."
