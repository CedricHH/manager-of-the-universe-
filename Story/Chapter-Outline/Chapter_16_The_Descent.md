## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Stairs

Victor walks down alone.
Each step echoes.
The air grows hotter. Smells of blood and old stone.
He doesn't bring weapons. He doesn't bring guards.
He brings **the ledger** (A mental list of assets).

### Beat 2: The Chamber

Floor 4: The Labyrinth.
Twisted corridors. Dead ends. Bones.
At the center: An arena-sized chamber.
**Asterion** waits.

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: First Impression

Asterion is... not what Victor expected.
Yes, he's massive (3 meters tall).
Yes, he's deadly (Bloodstained axe).
But he's also **sitting**.
Reading something? Scratching marks on the wall?
He looks... bored.

### Beat 4: The Confrontation

Asterion sees Victor.
He stands. The ground trembles.
> "You came. Alone. Unarmed."
> "Either brave or stupid."

Victor's response:
> "Neither. I came with an offer."

### Beat 5: Performance Review

Victor activates **[Performance Review]** openly.
Asterion feels it. Snorts.
> "You're scanning me? I could crush you before you react."

Victor reads the data:
> **[Asterion - Minotaur Guardian]**
> - Level: 25
> - Status: Bound to Floor 4 (Cannot leave)
> - Condition: Existential Despair (300 years in this room)
> - Desire: Purpose. Challenge. Death.

### Beat 6: The Revelation

Victor realizes: Asterion doesn't *want* tribute.
He wants someone to **kill him**.
Or give him a reason to live.

> "You're a prisoner here."
> Asterion pauses. "What do you know of prisons, little Manager?"
> Victor: "I know that no one chooses to guard an empty room for 300 years."

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Deal Proposal

Victor takes a breath.
> "I don't have food. I don't have gold. I don't have souls."
> "But I have something better."
> "I have a war to offer you."

Asterion's eyes narrow.
> "Explain."

### Beat 8: The Pitch

> "Adventurers are coming. Real ones. The rumors are spreading."
> "You've been fighting bored goblins and half-dead heroes for centuries."
> "What if I brought you an army? What if I made you relevant again?"

Asterion is silent.
Then he laughs. Deep. Rumbling.
> "You're either a genius or a fool."
> "Tell me your plan, Manager."
> "And I'll decide whether to eat you or listen."
