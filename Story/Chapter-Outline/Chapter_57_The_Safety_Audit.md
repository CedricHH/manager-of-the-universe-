# Outline: Chapter 57 - The Safety Audit

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

## Hook
Dawn breaks. The **Crimson Blades** arrive. They aren't typical adventurers; they are the Guild's "fixers." Four elites:
- **Kaelen (Leader/Paladin)**: Smug, heavily armored, carries a 'Clipboard of Judgment.'
- **Vara (Mage)**: specializes in "Structural Analysis" (blowing things up).
- **Torque (Rogue)**: Trap inspector.
- **Bruk (Barbarian)**: "Stress Tester."
Vorne stands outside, holding the stopwatch. "You have 6 hours to find a Class A violation. If you find one, we seal the doors."

## Development
### Beat 1: Administrative Warfare
Victor meets them at the entrance.
- **The Stalling**: Before they can enter, Victor presents them with 50-page "Third-Party Liability Waivers."
- **The Clause**: "Insolvia Holdings is not responsible for emotional damage caused by inadequate loot drops."
- Kaelen tries to storm in. Victor points out that entering without signing is "Trespassing," which invalidates their official status. They sign, furious.

### Beat 2: The Theater of Safety
The Blades enter the dungeon expecting chaos. They find a "Model Workplace."
- **Malicious Compliance**: The goblins are wearing hard hats and high-visibility vests. They aren't attacking; they are "conducting corridor maintenance."
- **The Provocation**: Bruk (Barbarian) tries to punch a goblin. The goblin flops (soccer dive). Sniv appears with a camera: "Workplace violence! Hostile work environment!"
- **The Trap Check**: Torque inspects a pit trap. It has a railing and a warning sign: "Caution: Gravity." He can't fault it. It's perfectly up to code.

### Beat 3: The Manufactured Crisis
Vorne (via communication crystal) gets impatient. "Break something, Kaelen! I don't care about the code, I need an excuse!"
- Kaelen decides to trigger a "Structural Failure." He orders Vara to cast [Seismic Pulse] on a main support pillar.
- **The Twist**: Victor allows it. The pillar cracks. Debris falls.
- Kaelen smiles. "Unsafe structure. Shutdown confirmed."
- Victor reveals the "compliance cam" footage. "That wasn't a structural failure. That was sabotage. And I just live-streamed it to the Town Square Projection Crystal."

## Cliffhanger
The crowd outside (from Ch 56) sees the footage and goes wild with anger. Vorne panics.
He abandons the legal pretense. "Code Red. Asset is non-compliant. Liquidate management."
The Crimson Blades stop acting like inspectors and draw their weapons for real.
**Status**: The audit is over. The Boss Fight begins.

## Checklist
- [ ] High-vis vests on goblins (Visual Gag)
- [ ] Victor uses "Safety Culture" as a weapon
- [ ] Vorne's desperation escalates
- [ ] Transition from comedy/bureaucracy to actual threat at the end
