# Chapter Outline: Chapter 80 - The Automation Protocol

## 1. Chapter Overview
- **Title**: The Automation Protocol
- **POV**: Victor Kaine
- **Core Action**: Victor begins the process of "offboarding" himself from the day-to-day management of Dungeon Insolvia. He promotes Sniv to Dungeon Manager and establishes the autonomous systems required for the dungeon to run without his direct supervision.
- **Cliffhanger**: A carriage with a royal seal arrives, but it's not the Prince. It's a "Recruitment Officer" from the Capital.

## 2. Pacing & Tone
- **Tone**: Reflective but unsentimental. Victor is treating his own "baby" (the dungeon) as a matured asset ready for passive income.
- **Pacing**: Moderate. Focus on the transition of leadership and the emotional weight (for the employees) of Victor's impending departure.
- **Corporate Focus**: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), succession planning, and autonomous revenue streams.

## 3. The Beats

### I. The Handover Meeting
- **Setting**: Victor's office, but Victor is standing while Sniv is sitting in the "Manager's Chair."
- **Action**: Victor delivers a 400-page manual of SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures).
- **Dialogue**: Victor explains that a true leader is someone whose absence doesn't affect the bottom line. Sniv is terrified but honored.

### II. The Promotion of Sniv
- **Beat**: Victor formally elevates Sniv to "Dungeon Manager (Level 1)." 
- **System**: ARMI grants Sniv limited administrative access.
- **Visual**: Sniv’s spectacles gleam as he reads the first autonomous revenue report. He’s no longer just a helper; he’s an executive.

### III. Asterion's New Mandate
- **Action**: Victor meets Asterion in the training grounds. 
- **The Task**: Asterion is promoted to "Chief Security Officer." His job is no longer to fight, but to train the next generation of bosses. 
- **The Insight**: Asterion realizes Victor is leaving. A rare moment of philosophical connection between the two "middle managers."

### IV. The Passive Income Engine
- **Beat**: Victor reviews the city-wide "Insolvia Integrated Logistics" network.
- **The Data**: The Hub, the labs, and the franchise fees are all funneling gold into the dungeon core autonomously.
- **The Realization**: Victor has created a system that no longer needs him. He is functionally "retired" from Oakhaven.

### V. The Royal Summons
- **Action**: A black carriage with silver filigree arrives at the dungeon entrance.
- **The Reveal**: It's not Prince Aldric. It's a representative from the **Bureau of Imperial Audit** in the Royal Capital.
- **The Hook**: Victor's performance has reached the Imperial level. They don't want to audit him; they want to *hire* him for a "Distressed Province" in the North.
