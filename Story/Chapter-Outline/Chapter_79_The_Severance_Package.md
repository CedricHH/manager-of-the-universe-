# Chapter Outline: Chapter 79 - The Severance Package

## 1. Chapter Overview
- **Title**: The Severance Package
- **POV**: Victor Kaine
- **Core Action**: Victor holds a mandatory "Shareholder Meeting" at the Oakhaven Adventurer Hub to dictate the terms of the Guild Coalition's surrender.
- **Cliffhanger**: Victor reveals the "Management Fee" for the Church's land, causing High Priestess Aurelia to face a choice between bankruptcy or subordinance.

## 2. Pacing & Tone
- **Tone**: Oppressive, clinical, and high-stakes. The "victory" is a cold administrative takeover.
- **Pacing**: Deliberate. The tension comes from the imbalance of power across a negotiation table.
- **Corporate Focus**: Debt-equity swaps, administrative fees, and non-compete clauses.

## 3. The Beats

### I. The Boardroom Setting
- **Setting**: The Grand Hall of the Adventurer Hub, now repurposed as Victor's temporary boardroom.
- **Visual**: The empty quest board, once the heart of hero activity, now just showing a static ARMI logo.
- **The "Board"**: Guildmaster Groll (broken), Captain Kael (fuming), and Arbitrator Valen (representing the Church).

### II. The Opening Statement
- **Action**: Victor enters. No armor, no weapons—just his cleaned Earth suit and a ledger.
- **The Pitch**: Victor doesn't call it a surrender. He calls it an "Involuntary Merger."
- **The Data**: ARMI displays the current debt-to-asset ratio of the Alchemist and Mercenary Guilds. It's terminal.

### III. The Counter-Offer (The Severance)
- **Beat**: Groll tries to threaten Victor with "public unrest."
- **Victor's Response**: He points to the 94% hero unemployment. "They aren't rioting against me, Groll. They're rioting against the management that lost their insurance coverage."
- **The Terms**: Victor offers a Debt-Equity Swap. He cancels their debts in exchange for 51% controlling interest in their guilds. They become "Subsidiaries of Dungeon Insolvia Management."

### IV. The Church's Liability
- **Action**: Arbitrator Valen tries to hide behind divine right.
- **Victor's Move**: He reveals the "back-rent" and "management fees" for the land beneath the Cathedral of Light.
- **The Threat**: If the Church doesn't approve the merger, Victor will "evict" the Cathedral assets for "Urban Redevelopment."

### V. The Cliffhanger
- **Action**: Victor slides a new contract to Valen. It's a "Service Level Agreement" for divine blessings.
- **The Hook**: Victor looks at the map of Oakhaven. He's not just managing a dungeon anymore. He's managing the region.
- **Final Line**: "Welcome to the new fiscal year."
