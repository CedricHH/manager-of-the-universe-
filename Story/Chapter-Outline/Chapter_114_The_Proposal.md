# Outline: Chapter 114 - The Proposal

**Word Target**: 1,800-2,000 words

## Continuity Verification
- [x] Faction conflict (Revolutionary vs Coalition) NOT previously resolved
- [x] No new antagonists duplicated (Vex continues)
- [x] Conflict type: Military/Political (differs from Arc 1 economic warfare)

---

## Hook (250-350 words)

**Opening**: 4:17 AM. Smoke still rising from battle damage. Victor stands in Ironhold war room with Dravik, reviewing casualty reports. 47 dead, 123 wounded—numbers Victor can't help calculating as payroll losses.

**Key Elements**:
- Dravik's "soldier's respect" demonstrated—addresses Victor as "Advisor" not "Consortium agent"
- 72-hour ultimatum clock visible on ARMI display (71:43:12 remaining)
- Revolutionary reinforcement estimates: Sera confirms full army mobilization (30,000 troops ETA 68 hours)
- Ironhold cannot survive direct assault (180 soldiers vs 30,000)

**Hook**: "If we can't win through force, we win through coalition. The enemy of my enemy—"
Dravik: "Is usually also my enemy."

## Development (1,100-1,400 words)

### Beat 1: Coalition Math (~400 words)
**The Problem**: Even combining all anti-Revolutionary factions, they can't match 30,000 troops.

**Victor's Analysis** (ARMI data):
- Legitimists (Princess Celestia): 4,000 troops, territorial control
- Theocrats (Church Remnant): 8,000 militants, defensive positions
- Merchant Coalition: 12,000 mercenaries (but owned by various interests)
- Warlords (Dravik): 180 effective

**Key Insight**: "We don't need to match their army. We need to make attacking *expensive*."

**Strategy**: Economic warfare adapted for military context. If Revolutionary attack costs more than the Bank is worth, they won't attack.

**Dravik's skepticism**: "Vex doesn't think in gold. He thinks in ideology."
Victor: "His generals think in gold. His soldiers think in survival. We target *them*."

### Beat 2: The First Contact (~400 words)
**Objective**: Contact Merchant Coalition—largest potential ally, most mercenary-minded.

**Sera's Intelligence**: Merchant Coalition controlled by three major houses:
- House Valorian (40%): Trade routes, pragmatic
- House Morthane (35%): Banking interests, risk-averse
- House Kieran (25%): Arms trade, opportunistic

**Coalition Overture**: Victor sends encrypted message via Consortium channel:
> "Galactic Audit Consortium proposes joint venture: Central Bank recovery. 25% equity stake for coalition participation. Response requested within 24 hours."

**Complication**: Merchant Coalition currently selling supplies to *all* factions (including Revolutionaries). Neutrality is profitable.

**Victor's Angle**: "Neutrality ends when the Revolutionaries control the Bank. They'll nationalize trade. You'll lose everything."

### Beat 3: Dravik's Revelation (~400 words)
**Moment of trust**: Dravik shows Victor the Bank vault (first Consortium agent to see it).

**Visual**: Massive underground complex. Not just gold—ledgers, trade agreements, pre-war contracts, land deeds. The Bank isn't just currency; it's *legitimacy*.

**Revelation**: "Whoever controls these documents controls Terra-Solvaris's legal framework. Every property deed, every marriage record, every noble title. The gold is secondary."

**Victor's realization**: This isn't 16.7M GP. This is *leverage over an entire planet*.

**ARMI update**:
> **[ARMI: ASSET REVALUATION]**
> Central Bank Tangible Assets: 16.7M GP
> Central Bank Intangible Assets: INCALCULABLE
> Status: MISSION PARAMETERS EXPANDED

**Dravik's condition**: "I'll support your coalition—if you guarantee the documents aren't destroyed. They're the only path to legitimate reconstruction."

## Cliffhanger (250-350 words)

**Merchant Coalition Response** (12 hours later):

Message arrives via magical projection. House Valorian representative (Lord Cassius Valorian):

> "The Consortium's offer is... interesting. However, we require clarification. You represent external interests. Why should we trust you won't simply extract the Bank's value and leave Terra-Solvaris to burn?"

**Victor's counter**: "Because I have a death clause. If this planet fails, I die. My survival requires your success."

**Valorian's pause**: "...Unusual incentive structure."

**Provisional agreement**: Merchant Coalition will send representative to Ironhold for formal negotiation. However—

**TWIST**: Sera intercepts Revolutionary communication.

> **[SERA: INTERCEPT]**
> Source: Tribune Vex Command
> Content: "Coalition forming. Accelerate timeline. 48 hours, not 72."

**CLIFFHANGER**: Ultimatum just shortened. Victor has half the time he expected to build a coalition that might not trust him.

**Final ARMI Message**:
> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 2, HOUR 18]**
> **[ULTIMATUM REVISED: 48 HOURS]**
> **[MERCHANT COALITION: NEGOTIATION PENDING]**
> **[MISSION CLOCK: 118 DAYS, 1 HOUR REMAINING]**

## Thematic Notes

This chapter establishes Victor's approach to Terra-Solvaris: he can't fight the war conventionally, so he'll make the war *economically irrational*. The Bank's intangible value (legal framework) raises mission stakes beyond simple gold recovery.

**Key Line**: "Armies fight for territory. Corporations fight for leverage. Same war, different spreadsheet."
