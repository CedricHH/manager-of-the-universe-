## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Alert

**ARMI Alert**:
> Perimeter Breach Detected
> Entity Count: 4
> Classification: Adventurer Party (Mid-Tier)
> Threat Level: Moderate
> ETA to Floor 1: 12 minutes

Victor: "Sniv. Status report on preparations."

Sniv: "Traps reset, Boss. Krog team in position. Asterion... still reading contract."

### Beat 2: The Stakes

Victor reviews the Core's deal:
- Current average per party: ~15 GP (loot drop after death)
- Target: 22.5 GP minimum (50% increase)
- Bonus target: 30 GP (100% = equity talk)

He has one shot to prove his model works.

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Party

The adventurers are introduced (Victor observes via Core's sensors):

**The Iron Wolves** (B-Rank Party):
- **Gareth** - Leader, Swordsman, arrogant
- **Mira** - Mage, cautious, intelligent
- **Bron** - Tank, silent, professional
- **Tessa** - Rogue, young, nervous (first real dungeon)

Better equipped than the Silver Lance. More experienced. More dangerous.

Victor: "They're not here for training. They're hunting."

### Beat 4: The Complication

Sniv reports: "Boss, Asterion ask question."

Victor: "What question?"

Sniv: "He ask... what if we just kill them? Old way. Simple."

Victor pauses.

The old way IS simpler. Four deaths = ~60 GP in loot and equipment. Well above target.

But that's not the model he pitched.

### Beat 5: The Trigger (Flashback Setup)

Victor stares at the party on the Core's display.

Mira the Mage reminds him of someone. The way she studies the corridor before advancing. The caution. The intelligence.

> *She reminds him of himself. Before.*

The thought unlocks something.

## FLASHBACK: Discovery of the Truth (Start)

### The Apartment (6 Months After Betrayal)

Victor sits in his luxury apartment. Empty whiskey bottles. Unwashed suits.

He's reading news articles about the scandal that destroyed him. The board's spin: "*Victor Kaine acted alone. We had no knowledge.*"

He knows it's a lie. But he's too tired to care.

### The Email

His phone buzzes. Anonymous sender. Attachment.

> Subject: *You probably already know this.*

He opens it.

Photographs. Invoices. A mine in a war zone.
Children. Dead children.
The materials—conflict minerals—came from THIS place.

His optimizations increased quotas.
His spreadsheets increased the body count.

Victor stares at the screen.

For the first time in his career, he asks:

> *"Where did the numbers come from?"*

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Back to Present

Victor blinks.

The Core's sensors show the Iron Wolves advancing. Floor 1.

Sniv: "Boss? Orders?"

Victor's voice is flat.

> "No kills. We do this my way."

Sniv hesitates.

> "But Boss... if we fail—"

Victor: "We won't."

He turns to the display table. Begins planning.

> "Gareth is arrogant. He'll take the bait. Mira is smart—she needs to see value, not threat. The tank follows orders. The young one..."

He pauses.

> "The young one lives. That's non-negotiable."

Sniv doesn't understand. Neither does Victor, entirely.

But somewhere deep, beneath the spreadsheets—

**He remembers what it costs when the numbers forget they're people.**

## Checklist

- [x] **Milestone**: Adventurer party introduced
- [x] **Flashback**: Discovery of conflict minerals begins
- [x] **Character Work**: Victor's buried humanity surfaces briefly
- [x] **Setup**: Non-lethal approach chosen, complicates execution
- [x] **Tension**: Can they hit 50% profit without killing?

## Notes for Writing

- **Flashback Format**: Italics or clear section break. Keep it short but brutal.
- **The Email**: Anonymous for now. Sarah's involvement implied but not confirmed.
- **Tone Shift**: Present = calculating. Past = hollow. Transition should be jarring.
- **The Young Rogue**: Tessa is deliberate. Victor protecting her echoes the dead children.

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
**Next Chapter**: Chapter 29 - The Negotiation (Flashback continues: Victor investigates further)
