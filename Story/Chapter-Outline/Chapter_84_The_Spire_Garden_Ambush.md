# Outline: Chapter 84 - The Spire Garden Ambush

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000

## Hook
Victor arrives at the High Auditor’s Spire Gardens. The setting is a masterpiece of Imperial waste: floating platforms of bioluminescent flora and mana-fountains that serve no purpose other than display. Victor’s ARMI interface is a constant scroll of red market updates. He observes the "Welcome Social" not as a party, but as a room full of distressed assets masking their panic with expensive wine. 

## Development

### Beat 1: The Social Minefield
Senior Partner Hestia greets Victor with her signature "Velvet Hammer" charm. She introduces him to the High Council members—the "shareholders" of the Empire’s political stability. Victor uses `[Performance Review]` to scan the room. He identifies Lord Aris and Lady Vane (no relation to Thaddeus) as being critically over-leveraged in Onyx Syndicate bonds. He calculates their "Liquidation Urgency" to be reaching 92%.

### Beat 2: The Governor's Gambit
Victor is introduced to Governor Malphas, the Duke of Valoria. Malphas is the archetype of a "Too Big To Fail" executive—arrogant, dripping in enchanted jewelry, and convinced his position is untouchable. He attempts to patronize Victor, offering him a "consultancy" (a bribe) to revise the Project Valoria risk assessment. Victor responds with cold, clinical logic, refusing the "off-books compensation."

### Beat 3: The Market Correction
Victor interrupts Malphas’s posturing by projecting the real-time ticker of the Aethelgard Exchange onto the garden’s mana-mists. He reveals that the Syndicate is currently undergoing a "Liquidity Event." He points out to the Council members exactly how much of their personal wealth has evaporated in the last hour. The social grace of the party collapses into internal panic. Victor presents Malphas with a "Restructuring Term Sheet."

## Cliffhanger
Malphas, realizing Victor has weaponized the market against him, drops the pretense of a civil social event. He reveals that the Onyx Syndicate has a "Strategic Asset Denial" protocol—a debt-trap linked to the Grey Spires mine’s mana-stability. "If you foreclose on me, Victor, I’ll ensure the North doesn't have enough mana to light its lamps for a decade. Do you really want to be the manager of a graveyard?"
