## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Deal

Gareth glares at Victor.
> "You'd let her die?"
> Victor: "I'd prefer she lives. But I have costs."

Alara interrupts.
> "Just tell him! She's dying!"

### Beat 2: The Payment

Gareth talks fast:
- The Guild is based in Oakhaven
- There are 5 registered parties active in this region
- The "Iron Vanguard" party is the strongest (Lv 20+)
- Dungeon bounties are posted monthly
- This dungeon? No bounty yet. They came for glory.

Victor hands over the potion.

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Recovery

Lysa drinks the potion.
She stabilizes. Not healed, but alive.
The party can escape.

Victor steps aside.
> "You're free to go."

### Beat 4: The Warning

Gareth stops at the exit.
> "This isn't over. The Guild will hear about this."
> Victor: "I'm counting on it."

### Beat 5: The Reports

The Silver Lance leaves.
Victor returns to Asterion.
> "The tribute is delivered. They ran."
> Asterion: "They were... adequate. The paladin had fire."
> "Bring more like her."

**Contract Update**:
> [Provisional Contract]: Fulfilled (Partial).
> Asterion Disposition: Neutral → Favorable.

### Beat 6: The Debriefing

Victor gathers his team:
- Sniv: "Boss traded water for whispers?"
- Victor: "Information is currency."
- Zip (A kobold, recruited from Floor 2?): "What information?"
- Victor: "The Guild. The structure. The weakness."

**Wait**: We haven't introduced Zip yet.
Let's say Victor found him in this chapter's B-plot.

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The New Recruit

While the fight happened, Sniv found something.
A **Kobold** hiding in Floor 2.
Small. Clever. Speaks broken Common.
> "Zip no fight! Zip build! Zip make traps!"

Victor examines him.
> [Performance Review]: Kobold Trap Expert. Level 6.

### Beat 8: Expansion Decision

Victor now has:
- 26 goblins (Workers/Guards)
- 1 Minotaur (Boss Monster, Ally)
- 1 Kobold (Engineer)

The dungeon is evolving from "mob" to "organization."
> "Sniv. Promote Zip to Head of R&D."
> Sniv: "What is R...and...D?"
> Victor: "He breaks things and makes better things."
