## Hook (200-300 words)

**Opening**: FLASHBACK continues directly from Chapter 52's cliffhanger.

**Scene**: Server room. Progress bar at 70%. Footsteps growing louder. Victor's hands steady on the keyboard. The download is almost complete — but so is his time.

**Tone**: Tension. Not panic (Victor doesn't panic), but the cold calculation of diminishing probabilities. Each second the security guard gets closer. Each second the download progresses.

## Development

### FLASHBACK Beat 1: The Final Stretch (400-450 words)

**Scene**: Server room. Download at 75%... 80%... The footsteps stop. Victor freezes. A door creaks — the security guard checking the adjacent utility closet.

**Victor's calculation**: Time to completion: ~90 seconds. Time until guard reaches his position: ~60 seconds. Options: Abort (waste six months of work), hide (risk detection and incomplete data), complete (risk everything).

**Decision**: Victor stays. He doesn't look at the door. He watches the progress bar.

**Internal**: "If this doesn't work, I die for nothing. If I abort, two hundred people die for nothing. The calculation hasn't changed."

**Near miss**: Guard's flashlight sweeps under the door. Victor is hidden behind a server rack. The light passes.

### FLASHBACK Beat 2: Download Complete (350-400 words)

**Moment**: 100%. The drive ejects. Victor pockets it. His hands are steady — they were never going to shake.

**Exit strategy**: He can't leave through the main door — the guard is still in the corridor. But there's a maintenance access shaft Victor mapped weeks ago. Just in case.

**The climb**: Victor squeezes through ventilation access, drops into a loading dock, emerges into the parking garage. His car is waiting. The lawyers' office is forty minutes away.

**Internal monologue**: Victor reflects that this is the most he's ever risked for *anything*. Every previous decision was calculated to maximize personal outcome. This one is calculated to minimize future harm — to people he'll never meet.

He still doesn't call it "good." He calls it "efficient reallocation of mortality probability."

### FLASHBACK Beat 3: The Drive (300-350 words)

**Scene**: Victor driving through empty late-night streets. The thumb drive in his pocket. The folder of forty-seven faces on the passenger seat.

**Internal**: He thinks about what happens next. The lawyers receive the evidence. The media receives leaks. The board receives subpoenas. And Victor receives... whatever the board's "connections" decide to send.

He's calculated his survival probability at 15%. Optimistic, really.

**The question**: Someone else might ask "why?" Victor doesn't ask that. He already knows the answer.

The math was right. That's all. The calculation made itself.

**Parallel**: Present-day Victor, preparing for the Crown Prince, is making the same type of calculation. High risk, high reward, uncertain survival. But this time, he intends to be the one who profits.

## Cliffhanger (200-250 words)

**SNAP BACK TO PRESENT**: Victor stands in the Core Chamber. Sniv, Asterion, Zip, and Valerius are gathered around a stone table. Nova projects a schematic of Eastmarch Keep.

"The Prince arrives in sixty-eight hours," Victor says. "Let's discuss our presentation."

But his mind is still in that car. The drive. The folder. The faces.

**Final beat**: Victor looks at his team — the goblin, the minotaur, the kobold, the nervous merchant. Monsters and misfits. His employees.

He thinks: *I died for strangers once. I wonder if I'd do it again.*

The thought is uncomfortable. He dismisses it.

**ARMI Message**: 
> **[ARMI - PSYCHOLOGICAL AUDIT CONTINUED]**  
> Memory Integration: 68% complete.  
> Remaining Segments: The Delivery, The Death.  
> Recommendation: Complete integration before high-stress operation.  
> Note: Unprocessed trauma degrades decision-making by ~12%.

Victor ignores the recommendation.
