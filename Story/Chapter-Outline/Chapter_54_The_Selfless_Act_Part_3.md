## Hook (200-300 words)

**Opening**: FLASHBACK continues. Victor's car pulls into a parking garage beneath a nondescript office building. 2:47 AM. The lawyers' office is on the eighth floor.

**Transition**: The previous chapter focused on escape and introspection. This chapter focuses on **the handoff** — the moment when Victor's six months of work becomes someone else's weapon.

**Tone**: Quiet tension. The hard part is over, but the consequences are just beginning.

## Development

### FLASHBACK Beat 1: The Parking Garage (350-400 words)

**Scene**: Victor parks. Sits in the car for a moment. The thumb drive is warm in his pocket. The folder of 47 faces rests on the passenger seat.

**Internal**: Victor considers turning around. Not out of fear — he doesn't feel fear. But out of the cold realization that once he walks into that building, the calculation becomes irreversible. Right now, he can still abort. Still walk away. Still choose the safe 98% survival path.

**Decision**: He gets out of the car. Takes the folder. Takes the drive. Walks to the elevator.

**Detail**: The parking garage is empty except for one other car — a sensible sedan, probably belonging to whoever agreed to meet him at 3 AM. Lawyers who work this late are either dedicated or desperate. Victor is counting on both.

### FLASHBACK Beat 2: The Meeting (500-550 words)

**Scene**: Eighth floor. A small law firm — Hartley, Chen & Associates. Employment litigation specialists. The office is dark except for one conference room.

**The Lawyer**: Sarah Chen. Mid-forties. Sharp eyes. The kind of lawyer who took a 40% pay cut to switch from corporate defense to plaintiff's work. She's been waiting for Victor for three months, ever since he made contact through an anonymous email chain.

**The handoff**: Victor places the thumb drive and the folder on the table. Explains what's on them. Walks Chen through the evidence chain — emails, financials, the government connection.

**Dialog focus**: Victor is clinical. Chen is stunned. She's handled corporate malfeasance cases before, but this is different. This is proof. Real, actionable, career-ending, prison-inducing proof.

**Key exchange**:
> Chen: "You understand this will destroy you too."  
> Victor: "I'm already destroyed. I just haven't stopped moving yet."

**Emotional beat**: Victor feels nothing. Chen feels everything. The contrast is deliberate — she's the human element Victor has lost.

### FLASHBACK Beat 3: The Warning (300-350 words)

**Scene**: Before Victor leaves, Chen stops him.

**The warning**: "They'll come for you. You know that. The people behind this — they don't let witnesses survive."

**Victor's response**: "I'm counting on it."

**Internal monologue**: Victor explains (to himself) that he's already calculated the timeline. Forty-eight hours until the first media leaks. Seventy-two until the regulatory response. After that, killing him becomes counterproductive — the evidence is out, and eliminating the source only confirms its validity.

But *before* that window? Before the evidence goes public?

He's a dead man walking.

**Departure**: Victor leaves the office. Takes the stairs, not the elevator. Old habit. He doesn't look back.

## Cliffhanger (200-250 words)

**SNAP BACK TO PRESENT**: Victor is standing in the dungeon corridor, alone. He's walked away from the War Room without realizing it. The memory has him.

**The final fragment**: He remembers walking to his car in that parking garage. Remembers sitting behind the wheel. Remembers looking at the empty passenger seat where the folder used to be.

Forty-seven faces. Given away. Entrusted to someone else's war.

**The question**: Did it matter? Did any of it matter?

**ARMI Interruption**:
> **[ARMI - MEMORY INTEGRATION]**  
> Segment Complete: The Delivery.  
> Remaining: The Death (Final Segment).  
> Integration Status: 84%.  
> Warning: Final memory contains termination event. Recommend supervision during processing.

Victor ignores the warning.

The next memory — the one he's been avoiding since he woke up in this world — is waiting.

**Final line**: "Tomorrow, then," Victor murmurs to himself. "Tomorrow I remember how I died."
