# Chapter Outline: Chapter 81 - The Imperial Onboarding

## 1. Chapter Overview
- **Title**: The Imperial Onboarding
- **POV**: Victor Kaine
- **Core Action**: Victor undergoes his first "employee orientation" with Thaddeus Vane inside the obsidian carriage as they travel toward the Imperial Capital, Aethelgard. They discuss the "Distressed Asset" in the North.
- **Cliffhanger**: Victor sees the Capital for the first time—a city built not just on trade, but on a massive, ancient, vertical structure that defies Oakhaven's scale.

## 2. Pacing & Tone
- **Tone**: Sophisticated, intimidating, and intellectual. The conversation is a high-level chess match between two auditors.
- **Pacing**: Steady. Focus on worldbuilding and the shift in stakes from regional to imperial.
- **Corporate Focus**: Institutional power, high-level auditing, and "Imperial Compliance."

## 3. The Beats

### I. The Carriage Briefing
- **Setting**: The interior of the obsidian carriage. It’s magically silent, climate-controlled, and feels like a luxury private jet.
- **Action**: Vane pours a drink that glows with mana. He places a "Briefing File" (a high-tier data crystal) on the table.
- **The Asset**: The North is revealed as the "Grey Spires," a mining province that has stopped reporting its numbers. The Governor is suspected of "creative accounting" on a massive scale.

### II. Corporate Mirroring
- **Beat**: Victor and Vane realize they speak the same language. Not common tongue, but *Audit*.
- **Dialogue**: Vane explains the Bureau's philosophy: "We don't punish sin; we punish inefficiency." Victor likes this.
- **Worldbuilding**: Discovery of the "Imperial Mana-Rail"—the carriage hitches onto a high-speed magical conduit. The speed is terrifying to anyone else; Victor just checks the "Travel Overhead" costs.

### III. The Competition
- **Action**: Vane mentions the "Senior Partners." Victor isn't the only Auditor. He’s just the newest "acquisition."
- **The Threat**: Other auditors might see Victor as a threat to their "Managed Territories."

### IV. Scaling Up
- **Beat**: Victor asks about the 500,000 GP signing bonus. 
- **The Reveal**: Vane explains that’s just the *operational budget*. The real prize is "Imperial Equity."
- **ARMI Alert**: The system begins to map the Imperial data-net. The level of information available is exponential compared to Oakhaven.

### V. The First Glimpse of Aethelgard
- **Action**: The carriage exits the mana-conduit on a high bridge.
- **The Visual**: Aethelgard is revealed. A vertical city built around a massive, glowing spire (The World-Tree or a magical construct). It makes the Cathedral of Light look like a garden shed.
- **Final Line**: Victor adjusts his tie. "I’m going to need a bigger briefcase."
