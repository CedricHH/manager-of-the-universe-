This chapter establishes Victor's control over dungeon infrastructure via the Core.

---

## Previously

Chapter 24 ended with:
- Dungeon infrastructure established
- Dungeon Core (7749) discovered
- Core is dormant, awaiting "Administrator Input"

---

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Interface

Victor touches the Core.
**ARMI Syncs with Core-7749.**

A new menu appears:
> **[Dungeon Management Console]**
> - Status: Inactive (No Administrator)
> - Mana Pool: 50/1000
> - Functions: Locked

### Beat 2: The Question

The Core "speaks" (Text in Victor's mind):
> QUERY: IDENTIFY.
> Victor: "I am Victor Kaine. Manager."
> QUERY: AUTHORITY SOURCE?
> Victor: "I... conquered this dungeon."

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Negotiation

The Core doesn't accept "conquest."
> CONQUEST = TEMPORARY. ADMINISTRATOR = PERMANENT.
> REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATOR STATUS:
> 1. Control of 50%+ of Dungeon Territory (CHECK)
> 2. Allied with Primary Guardian (CHECK - Asterion)
> 3. Capital Reserve of 100 GP (FAIL - Current: 35 GP)

Victor needs 100 GP to claim the dungeon formally.

### Beat 4: The Hustle

Victor has 3 weeks until the next adventurer wave (Based on Guild patterns).
He needs 65 more GP.

Options:
- Raid the surface (Risky, exposure)
- Increase production (Slow)
- Sell something valuable (What?)

### Beat 5: The Asset

Victor remembers: Marcus's glowing sword.
Soulbound = Can't use.
But the enchantment materials? Maybe worth something.
Zip examines it.
> "Zip can break enchant. Get... shiny dust. Worth much."

**Cost**: The sword is destroyed.
**Gain**: ~80 GP in mana-infused materials.

### Beat 6: The Decision

Victor makes the call.
> "Break it. We need the capital more than the lure."

Zip works for 2 days.
**Result**: 75 GP worth of Mana Dust.
**Total**: 35 + 75 = 110 GP.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: Administrator Access

Victor feeds 100 GP into the Core.
The crystal absorbs it.
Glows brighter.

> **ADMINISTRATOR REGISTERED: VICTOR KAINE**
> **DUNGEON: TEMPLE OF THE FORGOTTEN (Redesignated: INSOLVIA HQ)**
> **FUNCTIONS UNLOCKED:**
> - Monster Spawning (Basic)
> - Trap Automation
> - Perimeter Alerts

### Beat 8: The New Era

Victor looks at the glowing Core.
He owns the dungeon now.
Not just conquering. **Owning**.

But with ownership comes attention.
**ARMI Alert**:
> External Scan Detected.
> Source: Galactic Audit Consortium (Sector Monitor)
> Note: "Priority Asset flagged for observation."

Someone above is watching.
Victor has made the map.

**END OF ACT 1.2**

## Checklist

- [x] **Milestone**: Administrator access to Dungeon Core
- [x] **Sacrifice**: Marcus's sword destroyed for capital
- [x] **System**: Dungeon functions unlocked
- [x] **Foreshadowing**: The Consortium notices Victor

---

## Notes for Writing

- **Tone**: Triumphant but ominous.
- **The Sword**: Symbolic. The old hero's legacy is liquidated for Victor's empire.
- **Consortium**: Just a ping. Don't explain yet.

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
**Next Phase**: Act 1.3 (Ch 26-50) - Consolidation & External Threats
