## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Briefing

Victor assembles his leadership team:

- Nova (Core)
- Asterion (CSO)
- Sniv (COO)
- Krog (Guard Lead)

Victor: "I'll be gone for approximately one week. During this time, Sniv has operational authority. Asterion handles security. Nova monitors everything."

### Beat 2: The Concerns

Sniv: "Boss... what if bad humans come?"

Victor: "Iron Wolves are scheduled for return visit in 4 days. Standard protocol. Charge fees. Let them through. Don't kill unless provoked."

Asterion: "And if someone stronger comes?"

Victor: "Nova will signal me. But our profile is low. No one knows this dungeon matters yet."

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Disguise

Victor can't walk into Oakhaven looking like a dungeon lord.

He needs a cover.

**ARMI Suggestion**:
> Cover Identity: Traveling Merchant
> Equipment: Civilian clothing, fake trade license
> Companion: Zip (disguised as "exotic pet")

Victor: "Zip, can you pretend to be a pet?"

Zip: "Zip can pretend many things! Zip good actor!"

Victor: "You'll be in a bag. Don't talk."

Zip: "...Zip less good at not talking."

### Beat 4: The Inventory

Victor prepares supplies:
- 50 GP (operating cash)
- Premium dungeon goods (samples for "trade cover")
- R#1's journal (hidden, for reference)
- Black card (most important item)

Nova: "RECOMMEND CAUTION. CONSORTIUM WAYPOINTS MAY BE MONITORED."

Victor: "That's a risk I have to take. I can't stay at Level 1 forever."

### Beat 5: The Goodbye

Moment before departure.

Sniv approaches Victor privately.

> "Boss... you come back, yes?"

Victor pauses. Sniv's loyalty is... uncomfortable.

> "I always protect my investments, Sniv. You're my investment."

Sniv beams. He doesn't understand it's not quite affection.

Or maybe he does, and it's enough.

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 6: The Departure

Victor and Zip leave through the dungeon's hidden exit (discovered by Zip during renovations).

The surface.

Victor hasn't seen the sun since he arrived in this world.

**ARMI Alert**:
> External Environment: Safe
> Nearest Settlement: Oakhaven (2.7 days travel)
> Weather: Clear
> Threats Detected: None (immediate vicinity)

### Beat 7: The First Step

Victor looks back at the dungeon entrance.

Then forward at the road.

> "First time leaving the office in weeks. Let's see what this world actually looks like."

Zip scrambles into the travel bag.

> "Zip ready! Zip quiet! Zip—"

Victor: "Quiet starts now."

The bag goes silent.

Victor walks toward Oakhaven.

Behind him, the dungeon waits.

Ahead: civilization, danger, and the Consortium's attention.

## Checklist

- [x] **Transition**: Victor leaves dungeon for first time
- [x] **Delegation**: Clear command structure established
- [x] **Character Moment**: Sniv's loyalty, Victor's deflection
- [x] **Setup**: Oakhaven expedition begins
- [x] **Comedy**: Zip as "quiet pet" (impossible)

---

## Notes for Writing

- **Sniv Scene**: Emotional beat. Victor deflects but... something's there.
- **The Surface**: Victor seeing sun = symbolic. He's been in the dark.
- **Zip**: Comic relief throughout. Kobold cannot be quiet.
- **Tone**: Preparation chapter. Calm before city storm.

---

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
**Next Chapter**: Chapter 35 - The Road (Travel to Oakhaven, first surface encounters)
