# Outline: Chapter 62 - The Compliance Officer

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

## Hook
Morning at Insolvia Holdings. It's the first day of "Legal Operations."
Victor walks out to get the morning paper (or delivery).
He finds **Paladin Kaelen** (Wait, no, Kaelen is the mercenary - let's make it a new Paladin, **Sir Roland**) standing like a statue at the entrance.
**Roland**: "Good morning, Heretic."
**Victor**: "Good morning, Officer. Nice armor. Is it expensed?"

## Development
### Beat 1: The New Normal
The dungeon logic has changed.
- **Old Way**: Hide everything.
- **New Way**: Everything is legal, but reported.
Valerius is drowning in "Royal Tax Forms." Victor loves it (it's bureaucracy!), but the staff hates it.
Sniv is wearing a "Licensed Goblin" badge that is too big for him.

### Beat 2: The Stare-Down
The Paladin doesn't enter. He just *watches*.
Every adventurer who enters is scanned.
Business drops by 40%. Adventurers are nervous. "I don't want the Church seeing me grind here."
Victor realizes: **Surveillance is a sanction.** He needs to make the Paladin irrelevant or part of the appeal.

### Beat 3: The Marketing Pivot
Victor goes out to talk to the adventurers hesitant at the gate.
He rebrands the Church's presence.
"Why are you afraid? The Church is here because this is a **High-Security Royal Facility**. It's the safest dungeon in the world. Even the Gods are watching!"
He offers a discount: "The 'Penance Special'. Grind sin and earn XP."
It works partially. The boldest enter.

## Cliffhanger
The revenue is trickling back, but the Paladin is blocking the "high rollers" (Criminals/Necromancers who spent big).
Then, a courier arrives. Not from the Guild, not from the Church.
From the **Bank of Oakhaven**.
A letter: "Regarding your recent liquidity event (The 750g Settlement + Royal Taxes). We have an investment opportunity."
Victor smiles. "Finally. The real villains have arrived."

## Checklist
- [ ] Establish the oppressive atmosphere of the [Mark of the Watcher]
- [ ] Introduce Sir Roland (silent, judgmental menace)
- [ ] Victor spins "Surveillance" into "Safety"
- [ ] Setup for the Banking Arc
