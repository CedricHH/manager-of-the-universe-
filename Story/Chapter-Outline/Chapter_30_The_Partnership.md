## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Floor 4 - The Boss Room

The Iron Wolves stand before Asterion's chamber.

Sniv: "Optional premium encounter. Boss-class opponent. Recommended for parties above Level 15. Additional fee: 10 GP. Reward tier: Epic."

Gareth: "This is ridiculous. I'm not paying to fight."

Mira: "The reward tier IS compelling..."

### Beat 2: The Choice

Tessa: "What happens if we lose?"

Sniv consults clipboard: "Non-lethal defeat option available. 5 GP insurance. You wake up at entrance. Keep items acquired before boss."

Bron speaks for the first time: "...Fair."

**Decision**: They pay 10 GP for boss access + 5 GP insurance.

**Running total**: 35 GP

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Boss Fight

Asterion enters.

> "I am Asterion. Chief Security Officer. You have 10 minutes to demonstrate competence before I subdue you. Begin."

It's not a fight to the death.
It's a **performance evaluation**.

Asterion tests each party member:
- Gareth's aggression (grade: C - reckless)
- Mira's tactics (grade: B+ - adaptable)
- Bron's defense (grade: A - solid)
- Tessa's evasion (grade: A+ - natural talent)

### Beat 4: The Verdict

After 8 minutes, Asterion stops.

> "Sufficient. You may proceed to treasure room."

Gareth: "We... won?"

Asterion: "You survived. That is different. But per company policy, survival earns rewards."

### Beat 5: The Loot Room

Victor has curated the treasure room:
- Standard loot (weapons, potions) - Free with entry
- Premium items - Available for purchase
- Custom orders - "Pre-order for next visit"

Mira examines a staff: "This is... actually high quality."

Victor (via speaker): "I don't stock garbage. Repeat customers expect consistency."

**Party purchases**: 15 GP in premium items
**Running total**: 50 GP

## FLASHBACK: Discovery of the Truth (Conclusion)

### The Choice

Victor had everything.

Evidence. Names. Dates. Enough to destroy the board.

He could sell it. Blackmail them. Walk away rich.

Or...

### The USB Drive

He compiled it all onto a single drive.

Then he made copies. Sent them to:
- Three journalists (different outlets)
- The families' lawyers
- A regulatory contact in Geneva

Anonymous. Untraceable.

### The Question

As he finished, his phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number:

> *"You could've sold this. Why didn't you?"*

Victor stared at the message.

He didn't know the answer.

He typed back: *"Ask me when I figure it out."*

The sender: *"I will. -S"*

**Sarah. She'd been watching. She'd sent the original email.**

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Present: The Results

Iron Wolves exit the dungeon.

Mira turns back: "Same time next week?"

Victor: "10% discount. Bring friends."

Gareth mutters. Bron nods. Tessa waves.

They leave.

### The Accounting

Victor reviews:

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Entry Fee | 20 GP |
| Boss Access | 10 GP |
| Insurance | 5 GP |
| Premium Purchases | 15 GP |
| **TOTAL** | **50 GP** |

**Previous Average**: 15 GP (from killing and looting)
**New Model**: 50 GP (from business operations)
**Increase**: **233%**

### The Core's Response

The Dungeon Core pulses.

> "ADMINISTRATOR KAINE. YOUR PROOF... EXCEEDS PARAMETERS."

Victor: "I believe we discussed equity."

Long pause.

> "...PARTNERSHIP TERMS ACCEPTED. FULL INFRASTRUCTURE ACCESS GRANTED."

**ARMI Update**:
> Dungeon Status: ACTIVE (Victor Kaine - Majority Shareholder)
> New Functions Unlocked:
> - Advanced Monster Spawning
> - Defensive Architecture
> - Revenue Tracking Dashboard

Victor looks at the glowing Core.

> "Welcome to the team, 7749."

> "...DESIGNATION ACCEPTED. CALL ME... NOVA."
