---

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Battle Plan

Victor gathers the Guard Team.
He draws a map of Floor 3 (based on Sniv's reports):
- Central chamber (Hostile tribe's base)
- Two entrances (South and East)
- Narrow corridors (Choke points)

Victor's strategy: **Divide and conquer**.
> "We don't fight all 28. We fight 10 at a time."

### Beat 2: The Weapons Check

Current arsenal:
- Rusty shivs (3)
- Sharpened sticks (8)
- Rocks (infinite)
- Acid sacs (3, untested as weapons)

Victor tests one acid sac on a wall.
It hisses. Burns.
> "Prototype grenades. Don't use unless I say."

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Approach

Victor leads the Guard Team (4) + Sniv down to Floor 3.
The corridors are darker here. Older.
They hear goblin chatter ahead.

Victor uses **[Performance Review]** on a hostile goblin (from hiding):
> **[Feral Goblin]**
> Level: 4
> Morale: Low (Hungry)
> Loyalty: None (Tribal only)
> Weakness: Unorganized

### Beat 4: The Trap

Victor sets up an ambush:
- Food Team goblins create noise at one entrance
- Guard Team waits at the other entrance
- When hostiles investigate the noise, Guard Team flanks

The plan works. Partially.
5 hostile goblins charge the noise.
Guard Team hits them from behind.
**Result**: 3 hostiles dead, 2 flee.

### Beat 5: The Retaliation

The hostile tribe realizes they're under attack.
The Alpha (Bigger, meaner goblin, Level 6) rallies his pack.
They charge Victor's position.

Victor is outnumbered: 15 hostiles vs 5 loyalists.

### Beat 6: The Acid Test

Victor grabs an acid sac.
He throws it at the charging Alpha.
Direct hit. The sac bursts.
The Alpha screams. His face melts.
The charge breaks. Panic.

**Victor's Realization**: Weapons > Numbers.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Surrender

The hostile tribe scatters.
But one goblin approaches Victor.
He's smaller. Scarred. Older.
He kneels.
> "No more fight. You strong. We serve."

### Beat 8: The Decision

Victor could kill him. Eliminate the threat.
But killing doesn't grow the company.

> "How many of you will follow?"

The scarred goblin looks back.
12 hostile goblins emerge from the shadows.
Defeated. Hungry. Looking for a new Boss.

**ARMI Alert**:
> Hostile Takeover: Partial Success.
> New Employees: 12 (Probationary).
> Total Workforce: 26.
