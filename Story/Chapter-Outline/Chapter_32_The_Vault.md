## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Breaking the Seal

Victor touches the ancient stone.

**ARMI Analysis**:
> Seal Age: 2,000+ years
> Origin: Pre-Consortium Era
> Warning: Contents unknown. Proceed?

Victor: "Nova, what do you know about this?"

Nova: "NOTHING. THIS STRUCTURE PREDATES MY CREATION BY 1,700 YEARS. I WAS... BUILT ON TOP OF IT."

### Beat 2: The Opening

Victor channels 10 GP into the seal (arbitrary cost).

The stone cracks. Glows. Crumbles.

A passage opens into darkness.

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Descent

Victor, Asterion, and Zip descend.

The architecture changes. Not dungeon stone—something older. Carved with precision no goblin could match.

Zip: "This... not dungeon work. This is *civilization* work."

### Beat 4: The Vault

They reach a chamber.

Inside:
- Pedestals with dust-covered objects
- A crystalline archive (records?)
- A skeleton in ancient armor, clutching a book

Victor examines the book. The text is old, but ARMI translates:

> *"Restructurer #1 - Final Report"*
> *"The Consortium's experiment begins. This world is designated: TERRA-INSOLVIA."*
> *"I have hidden what they must not find. If you read this, another Restructurer has come."*
> *"Beware. They do not send us to save worlds. They send us to harvest them."*

### Beat 5: The Revelation

Victor stares at the text.

He's not the first. There was a Restructurer #1—and they left a warning.

The Consortium doesn't save worlds. It **harvests** them.

Victor: "Nova... did you know about this?"

Nova: "I... DID NOT. BUT I AM A CONSORTIUM CREATION. PERHAPS I WAS DESIGNED NOT TO KNOW."

### Beat 6: The Loot

Despite the revelation, Victor is practical.

He catalogues the vault contents:
- **Ancient Armor** (degraded, but materials valuable): ~50 GP
- **Crystal Archive** (information = power): Priceless
- **Restructurer's Journal** (extends beyond the book): Unknown value
- **Three sealed containers** (unknown contents): Risk assessment needed

Victor: "We take everything. Carefully."

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Last Container

As they prepare to leave, Victor notices a fourth container. Hidden. Smaller.

He opens it.

Inside: A single item. A **black card** inscribed with gold text:

> **GALACTIC AUDIT CONSORTIUM**
> **Priority Asset Transfer Notice**
> **Recipient: Designated Restructurer**
> **Contents: [REDACTED]**
> **Status: Awaiting Claim**

Victor holds the card.

**ARMI Alert**:
> External Scan Detected (Elevated)
> Source: Galactic Audit Consortium
> Status: "Priority Asset Flagged. Awaiting Response."

They knew this vault existed.
They knew someone would find it.
They've been waiting for 2,000 years.

Victor: "...They're not just watching. They left this **for** whoever came next."

Asterion: "Is that... a gift?"

Victor: "In my experience, gifts from management always come with strings attached."

He pockets the card.

## Checklist

- [x] **Milestone**: Ancient vault discovered
- [x] **Lore**: Restructurer #1 existed, left warning about Consortium
- [x] **Worldbuilding**: Terra-Insolvia = Consortium experiment
- [x] **Mystery**: Black card = asset transfer, awaiting claim
- [x] **Tension**: Consortium has been waiting 2,000 years

---

## Notes for Writing

- **Restructurer #1's Skeleton**: Don't linger. Mystery > exposition. They died here. Why?
- **The Warning**: "Harvest, not save" = core revelation. Don't over-explain.
- **Black Card**: Chekhov's gun. Will be used later (Arc 1 finale or Arc 2).
- **Tone**: Discovery horror. Victor finds something bigger than himself.

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
**Next Chapter**: Chapter 33 - The Crystal Archive (Victor studies #1's records)
