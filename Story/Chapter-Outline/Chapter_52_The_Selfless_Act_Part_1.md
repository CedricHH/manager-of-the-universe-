## Hook (200-300 words)

**Opening moment**: Victor in the dungeon war room, preparing for Crown Prince Aldric's arrival. The team is working around him — Sniv organizing documents, Asterion reviewing security protocols, Nova projecting data.

**Trigger for flashback**: Victor realizes this is his first "real victory" — not just survival, not just defense, but positioning for *acquisition* of a royal asset. The magnitude of the play reminds him of another time he took a massive risk. The stakes were different then. The outcome was... death.

**Transition**: Victor's eyes glaze over as a memory surfaces. The chapter shifts to FLASHBACK.

## Development

### FLASHBACK Beat 1: The Night Before (450-500 words)

**Setting**: Earth. Victor's corner office, 11 PM. Six months after Project Cobalt was buried. Six months after the board sacrificed him to the press.

**Scene**: Victor sits alone in his office. The building is empty. He's no longer CEO — just a "Special Consultant" kept around because he knows too much. The board pays him to stay quiet. He accepted the deal.

**Internal conflict**: Victor tells himself he did nothing wrong. The supply chain was his responsibility, but who checks *every* subcontractor? The deaths were tragedies, not crimes. The board made the real decisions. He just... signed orders.

**The file on his desk**: A thick folder. Photos of the dead. Forty-seven faces. Children. Workers. Families. The lawyers sent it as "leverage." Victor has looked at it every night for six months.

**Tone**: Hollow. Victor is empty. He has money, safety, silence. He has nothing.

### FLASHBACK Beat 2: The Decision (400-450 words)

**The realization**: Victor has been auditing himself. Not for guilt — he doesn't *do* guilt. For efficiency. And the math doesn't work.

The board got away with murder. They're still running the company. They'll do it again. Different project, different continent, different faces. Same outcome. The system is *broken*, and Victor is part of the machine that keeps it running.

**The calculation**: If he stays silent, the expected deaths from future negligence: ~200 over the next decade. If he releases the evidence he's been secretly compiling: Personal survival probability drops to near-zero. But the company burns. The board goes to prison. Future deaths prevented: ~200.

**Victor's moment**: "The math is clear. I die, or they do it again. And I was always going to die eventually."

**He opens the server room door**.

### FLASHBACK Beat 3: The Server Room (300-350 words)

**Scene**: Basement of the corporate headquarters. Victor accessing restricted files. He's been doing this for six months — copying emails, financial records, shell company documents, payment receipts from the conflict mineral suppliers.

**The thumb drive**: Everything the lawyers need. Everything the board buried. Victor plugs it in. The download begins.

**Internal monologue**: Victor reflects that this is the first time he's ever done something with negative ROI for himself. Every decision before was calculated for personal gain. This one is calculated for... something else. He doesn't have a word for it.

**The noise**: Footsteps above. Security making rounds. Victor works faster.

## Cliffhanger (200-250 words)

**SNAP BACK TO PRESENT**: Victor startles. Sniv is calling his name.

"Boss? Boss! You okay? You had faraway-eyes. Like when Boss thinking about killing something, but *sad* killing."

Victor blinks. The Core Chamber. The dungeon. Terra-Insolvia.

He's not in that server room anymore. He's not *that* Victor anymore.

Or is he?

**ARMI Message**: 
> **[ARMI - PSYCHOLOGICAL AUDIT]**  
> Memory integration detected: Pre-reincarnation trauma.  
> Warning: Emotional processing inefficient. Recommend compartmentalization.  
> Note: The Consortium selected you for that anomaly. The decision in that server room. The one that didn't calculate.

Victor dismisses the message.

**Final line**: "I'm fine, Sniv. Just... remembering why I'm here."

The flashback will continue in Chapter 53.
