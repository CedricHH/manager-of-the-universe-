# Outline: Chapter 60 - The VIP Experience

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

## Hook
The standoff in the lobby. Aurelia is sniffing around for "heresy." Victor is in full "Sales Mode."
**Aurelia**: "This place reeks of death."
**Victor**: "That is the scent of *Efficiency*, Your Holiness. And lavender."

## Development
### Beat 1: The Tour
Victor gives the VIP tour. He frame *everything* in corporate/capitalist terms to appeal to the Prince (who is bored) while dodging Aurelia's religious inquiries.
- **The Kobolds**: "Sanitation Engineers."
- **The Slimes**: "Eco-friendly waste management solutions."
- **The Traps**: "High-impact cardio training equipment."
Prince Aldric is amused. He's never seen a dungeon run like a business. He asks about the "ROI."

### Beat 2: The Test
Aurelia isn't buying it. She demands a demonstration.
"Show us why this... *facility*... is valuable to the Crown. Can it defend the realm?"
She summons a **Sun-Construct** (a minor angel/guardian) to test the defenses.
Victor can't use his lethal traps (Aurelia would see it as dark magic).
He has to use *non-lethal, entertaining* defense.
He orders the **Iron Wolves** to perform a "synchronized takedown" (drilled heavily by Kael). It looks more like a circus act than a battle, but it works.

### Beat 3: The Proposition
Aldric taps his finger. "It's clever. But why shouldn't I just seize it?"
Victor plays his trump card: **The Fiscal Crisis**.
He knows (from Art 1.3 intel) that the Kingdom is broke.
"Your Highness, seizing this asset costs money. Maintenance. Guards. Bureaucracy. *Partnering* with me generates revenue. I can turn this dungeon into a gold mine for the Crown."
He offers a 15% Royal Tax (off the books, direct to the Prince's discretionary fund).

## Cliffhanger
Aldric smiles. "I like him, Aurelia. He speaks my language."
Aurelia narrows her eyes. "He speaks the language of the Serpent."
Aldric accepts the "partnership" provisionally. He wants to see the "VIP Level" (Floor 3).
But as they move deeper, Victor gets an ARMI alert: **"Divine Audit in progress. Holy Magic detecting Core signature. Probability of exposure: 88%."**
Aurelia is actively scanning for the Core. If she finds Nova, it's game over.

## Checklist
- [ ] Victor uses "Corporate Speak" to baffle a religious zealot
- [ ] Prince Aldric established as greedy/bored but sharp about money
- [ ] Aurelia established as a terrifying threat who sees through the BS
- [ ] First use of "Entertaining Combat" to hide lethality
