## Previously

Chapter 3 ended with:
- Victor explored ARMI in depth (0 GP = powerless)
- First memory fragment: "I was a manager. A boardroom."
- Sniv returned with a census (28 hostile goblins, rats, slimes)
- Food crisis: 4 hours before cannibalism
- Victor: "Show me Floor 2. The slimes."

---

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Descent

Victor leads a small party to Floor 2:
- Himself (unarmed, Level 1)
- Sniv (tiny, loyal)
- 3 goblins (the least hostile ones)

The corridor is dark. Slippery.
Victor uses Marcus's broken torch (30 minutes of light).

### Beat 2: First Impressions

Floor 2: The Fungal Gardens.
- Bioluminescent mushrooms
- The stench of rot and growth
- **Slimes** everywhere (oozing blobs of jelly)

Victor activates **[Performance Review]** on a slime:
> **[Basic Slime]**
> Level: 2
> Drops: Slime Jelly (Edible?), Acid Sac (Corrosive)
> Behavior: Passive unless touched
> Value: 2 GP (estimated)

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The First Kill

Victor doesn't fight. He directs.
> "Surround it. Poke it with sticks. Drive it into the corner."

The goblins follow (crudely).
One goblin gets acid-burned. Screams.
But the slime is cornered.
Sniv smashes it with a rock.

**ARMI Alert**:
> Kill Registered.
> XP Distributed.
> Loot: Slime Jelly x1.

**Victor's First GP**: The jelly could be sold. But for now, it's food.

### Beat 4: The Taste Test

Victor examines the jelly.
It smells like ammonia and sugar.
> "Sniv. Taste it."
> Sniv: "Boss first?"
> Victor: "Delegation is key to management."

Sniv eats a bit. Waits.
He doesn't die.
> "Is... okay. Burns throat. But fills belly."

**Food Source**: Confirmed.

### Beat 5: The Grind Begins

Montage of slime hunting.
- Kill → Collect → Repeat
- The goblins learn Victor's "funnel" technique
- Fewer injuries
- More jelly

After 2 hours:
- 15 slimes killed
- 15 Slime Jellies (Enough for 15 meals)
- 3 Acid Sacs (Collected for "future use")
- Victor's XP: Minimal (He didn't fight)
- **GP Estimate**: 30 GP (if sold)

### Beat 6: The Discovery

While collecting jelly, Victor notices something.
A **Giant Rat** is eating a dead slime.
It's fat. Healthy.
> "Protein."

He points.
> "New target."

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Rat King?

They chase the rat into a tunnel.
The tunnel opens into a nest.
Not one rat. **Twelve**.
And one massive **Alpha Rat** (Level 5).

The Alpha hisses. The pack surrounds Victor's team.

### Beat 8: The Negotiation (Again?)

Victor is outnumbered.
He doesn't panic.
> "ARMI, can I communicate with rats?"

**ARMI Response**:
> Rats: Minimal Intelligence.
> Communication: Pheromone-based.
> Negotiation Success Rate: 2%.
> Recommendation: Combat or Retreat.

Victor looks at the slime jelly in his bag.
Rats eat slimes.
> "Sniv. Throw them a jelly."

Sniv throws.
The Alpha sniffs. Eats.
It stops hissing.

> "I think we just invented bribery at the rodent level."

## Checklist

- [x] **Action**: First real "hunt" (Slimes)
- [x] **System**: XP gains, Loot drops
- [x] **Humor**: Sniv taste-testing, rat bribery
- [x] **Pacing**: Slow build, no major threats
- [x] **Cliffhanger**: The Rat Nest (new opportunity/threat)

---

## Notes for Writing

- **Tone**: Survival mode. Gritty. Small victories.
- **Victor**: Not a fighter. A coordinator.
- **Foreshadowing**: The acid sacs will be useful later (grenades?).
