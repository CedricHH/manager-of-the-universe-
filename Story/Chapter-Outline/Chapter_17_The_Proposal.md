## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Negotiation Table

Victor sits on a broken pillar.
Asterion remains standing (He doesn't need chairs).
The air is thick with tension.

Victor lays out his pitch:
> "Here's the situation. This dungeon is a failing business."
> "No adventurers. No loot cycle. No purpose."
> "You're the final boss of nothing."

### Beat 2: Asterion's History

Asterion interrupts:
> "I was placed here by the gods. To guard the temple."
> "The temple is rubble. The gods are silent."
> "I guard **nothing**."

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Value Proposition

Victor nods.
> "Then stop guarding. Start **hunting**."
> "I'll bring adventurers to you. Real challenges."
> "In exchange, you protect the dungeon from threats I can't handle."

### Beat 4: The Terms

Asterion considers.
> "And what do you get, Manager?"
> Victor: "I get a deterrent. No one attacks a dungeon with a boss."
> "And I get your experience. 300 years of combat knowledge."

### Beat 5: The Counter

Asterion leans forward.
> "You think I'll serve a goblin-master?"
> Victor: "I think you'll serve yourself."
> "Work with me, and you fight. Work against me, and you sit here. Alone. Forever."

### Beat 6: The Test

Asterion stands.
> "Words are easy. Prove your worth."
> "Bring me a worthy opponent within one month."
> "Fail, and I burn your little empire to the ground."

**ARMI Alert**:
> **[Contract: Provisional]**
> Party A: Victor Kaine (Manager)
> Party B: Asterion (Guardian)
> Terms: Deliver "worthy opponent" in 30 days
> Penalty: Total annihilation

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Handshake

Victor stands.
He extends his hand.
Asterion stares at it.
> "Human custom? Goblins don't do this."
> Victor: "It's a contract. A promise."

Asterion's massive hand engulfs Victor's.
He could crush it. He doesn't.
> "One month, Manager."

### Beat 8: The Return

Victor climbs back to Floor 5.
Sniv is waiting, terrified.
> "Boss alive! Boss not eaten!"
> Victor: "We have 30 days."
> "Get me a map of every road to Oakhaven."
> "We're going to advertise."
