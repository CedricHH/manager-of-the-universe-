## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Sterling Manor

Victor arrives at the estate.

**Description**:
- Impressive but dated architecture
- Shows wealth but no recent investment
- Guards professional, equipment maintained
- Victor's ARMI analyzes: "Capital rich, cash poor"

### Beat 2: The Wait

Victor placed in receiving room.

Deliberate power play - make the merchant wait.

Victor uses time to observe:
- Furnishings: Quality but aging
- Servants: Well-trained but minimal staff
- Account books visible on desk (left deliberately?)
- Victor notes: Sterling wants to appear wealthier than he is

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: Lord Sterling Appears

**Character Introduction** (Direct):
- Mid-40s, military bearing, expensive but practical clothing
- Not pompous - professional, calculating
- Level 18-20 (Victor's [Performance Review] estimate)
- Speaks like businessman, not noble stereotype

Sterling: "My men say you have a business opportunity. I'm listening."

### Beat 4: The Negotiation Dance

Victor presents carefully:

1. **Acknowledge Sterling's position**: "You control dungeon access. Smart monopoly."
2. **Identify mutual benefit**: "But monopolies have limits. I can expand your market."
3. **Offer value**: "I represent managed dungeon operation. Premium goods at scale."

Sterling counters:
- "Or I confiscate your goods and eliminate competition."
- "What stops me from simply taking what you have?"

Victor's response:
- "Short-term gain vs. long-term revenue stream."
- "You take my crystals once, or partner and receive percentage forever."

### Beat 5: The Demonstration

Sterling wants proof.

Victor pulls out merchant documentation (Nova's forgeries):
- Trade manifests
- Quality certifications  
- Sample products

Sterling examines - professional eye, not easily fooled.

Then Victor shows the black card. Doesn't explain it - just lets Sterling see the Consortium markings.

Sterling's expression shifts. He recognizes something.

### Beat 6: The Offer

Sterling leans back: "You're not a simple merchant."

Victor: "No. I'm a resource manager with infrastructure you need and products you want. Licensing arrangement: I operate, you receive 15% gross revenue for permit legitimization."

Sterling: "30%."

Victor: "20%, and I handle all operational costs."

Sterling considers.

**Complication**: Sterling receives message - urgent. Dungeon incident.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Dungeon Problem

Messenger enters: "My Lord, the eastern dungeon - there's been an incident. Three adventurer parties went missing. The dungeon's... changed."

Sterling's attention divides.

Victor: "Changed how?"

Messenger (nervous): "The monsters are... organized. Setting traps. One party sent runner back saying they faced 'coordinated defense.' Like soldiers, not beasts."

Sterling looks at Victor with sudden suspicion.

Sterling: "You said you represent a 'managed dungeon operation.' Which dungeon?"

Victor calculates rapidly.

Options:
1. Admit it's his dungeon (risky but builds credibility)
2. Deflect (maintains deniability but damages trust)
3. Leverage the chaos (offer solution)

Victor chooses strategy.

Victor: "The tutorial dungeon. Two days west. And those 'organized monsters' are my employees."

Sterling stands. Hand on sword.

Sterling: "You're the one causing my dungeon problems."

Victor stays seated. Calm.

Victor: "I'm the one solving a market inefficiency. Your old dungeon was stagnant - random Victims, no revenue control, wasted potential. I optimized it. And I'm offering to do the same for your others."

Sterling: "Or I arrest you NOW and claim your operation."

Victor smiles.

Victor: "Try. My dungeon is two days away, fully operational, and has standing orders: If I don't return in 72 hours, they seal the entrance and collapse the access tunnels. You'd lose everything."
