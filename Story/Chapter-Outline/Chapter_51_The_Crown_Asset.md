## Hook (200-300 words)

**Opening moment**: The dungeon's war room. Valerius paces nervously while Nova projects intelligence data. Victor has transformed the Core Chamber into a strategic command center.

**Opening line focus**: Victor studying a projection of Crown Prince Aldric — "The Adventurer Guild had made a critical error. They assumed Victor would wait for their petition. They assumed wrong."

**Tone**: Calm, calculating. Victor sees the Guild's threat as an opportunity — if he reaches the Crown first, he doesn't just survive, he *expands*.

## Development

### Beat 1: Intelligence Briefing (400-450 words)

**Scene**: War room briefing with Sniv, Nova, and Valerius.

**Key points**:
- Sniv presents the intelligence he's gathered on Crown Prince Aldric (debts, vices, ambitions)
- Aldric is 27, idealistic, still believes in the system — but he's also the kingdom's primary tax inspector for eastern territories
- The kingdom is secretly hemorrhaging gold (wars, corruption) — the King hides this from his son
- Prince Aldric is scheduled to visit Eastmarch within the month for a "routine inspection"

**ARMI System Message**: Analysis of Crown Prince Aldric — threat classification, opportunity assessment, leverage points.

**Corporate lens**: Victor sees Aldric as a "junior executive" — idealistic but inexperienced. The play isn't to corrupt him, it's to *educate* him.

### Beat 2: The Competitive Analysis (400-450 words)

**Scene**: Valerius (the double agent from Merchant Guild) provides intel on what the Adventurer Guild knows.

**Key points**:
- Inspector Vorne has already filed preliminary findings
- Guild petition is being drafted — estimated 2-3 weeks until formal submission
- BUT: The Guild doesn't know Victor has his own inside man at Merchant Guild
- Guild's strategy: invalidate permits → seize dungeon assets → "cleanse" the area

**Character moment**: Valerius is terrified but committed — he's already too deep to back out. Victor reassures him with a contract extension and hazard pay.

**Strategic insight**: Victor realizes the Guild thinks in terms of *elimination*. Victor thinks in terms of *acquisition*. Different game, different rules.

### Beat 3: The Play (300-350 words)

**Scene**: Victor outlines his strategy to reach Crown Prince Aldric before the Guild petition.

**Key points**:
- Step 1: Position the dungeon as a *Crown revenue source*, not a territorial liability
- Step 2: Arrange a meeting with the Prince during his eastern inspection tour
- Step 3: Present a compelling economic case — if the kingdom is bleeding gold, Victor offers a transfusion
- **The gamble**: Victor is betting Aldric wants to impress his father with solutions, not problems

**ARMI System Message**: Strategic recommendation — "Regulatory Capture" protocol. Instead of fighting the Crown, *become useful to it*.

**Corporate reference**: "Every regulator can be turned into a stakeholder. You just have to find the right offering price."

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

**Scene**: Just as Victor finalizes his strategy, Zip (the kobold) bursts in with urgent news.

**The reveal**: A royal messenger has arrived at the forest edge. Not a Guild operative — someone bearing the Crown's seal directly.

**The twist**: Crown Prince Aldric isn't waiting for a petition. He's already on his way to Eastmarch. He'll be here in *three days*.

**Victor's reaction**: For the first time, Victor is behind schedule. Someone else is moving faster than he calculated.

**ARMI Final Message**: "Timeline accelerated. Opportunity window: 72 hours. Status: URGENT."

**Last line**: Victor straightens his jacket. "It seems the Prince wants to see the books. Let's make sure he likes what he finds."
