---

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Asterion's Response

The imp returns.
It carries a response (A bone with scratches):
> "Amusing. One week extension granted."
> "Entertain me, Manager. Or feed me."

Victor exhales.
7 more days.

### Beat 2: The Campaign

Victor gathers the team.
> "We have 7 days to attract adventurers."
> "Step 1: Make the dungeon look valuable."

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: Trap Redesign

Victor inspects the dungeon entrance (Floor 1).
It's a mess. Rubble. Bones. Nothing inviting.

He orders:
- Clear the rubble (Make it accessible)
- Leave *some* bones (Looks dangerous = treasure inside)
- The spike trap that killed Marcus: Keep it. But mark it faintly.

### Beat 4: The Bait

Marcus's glowing sword is still soulbound.
Victor can't use it. But he can **display** it.

He places it on a pedestal in Floor 3.
Visible from the entrance corridor.
Glow = "TREASURE HERE."

### Beat 5: The Rumor Mill

Victor sends Sniv back outside with a new mission:
- Find travelers
- "Accidentally" mention the "glowing sword in the old temple"
- Run away before they ask questions

Sniv is nervous.
> "What if they catch Sniv?"
> Victor: "Then you're a crazy forest goblin. They'll shoot you and move on."
> "Or they'll follow the rumor."

### Beat 6: The First Bite

3 days later.
Sniv reports: "Merchants talking about glowing sword."
The rumor is spreading.

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Scouts

**ARMI Alert**:
> Perimeter Activity Detected.
> Entities: 2
> Class: Adventurer (Low-Level)
> Gear: Cheap

Two young adventurers approach the entrance.
They're not heroes. They're **noobs**.
Leather armor. Wooden shields. Excited faces.

### Beat 8: The Test Run

Victor watches from the shadows.
> "Let them in. Don't kill them. Scare them. Take their stuff."
> "They need to run back and tell everyone what they saw."

The dungeon's first "customers" have arrived.
