## Hook (200-300 words)

**Opening**: EARTH. THREE DAYS LATER.
**Scene**: Victor is in his apartment. It's night. He's drinking scotch — not because he likes it, but because it feels like something a condemned man should do.
**Context**: The first leaks hit the news cycle six hours ago. "PROJECT COBALT EXPOSED." The board has issued denials. The stock dropped 14%. The war has started.
**The Event**: Victor hears the lock click. Not a key. A pick. Electronic bypass.
**Reaction**: He doesn't run. He pours another finger of scotch. He's been waiting for this.

## Development

### FLASHBACK Beat 1: The Termination (450-500 words)

**The Intruder**: Professional. Efficient. Wearing a maintenance uniform. No mask — they don't expect witnesses.
**The Confrontation**: There isn't one. No monologue. No "why did you do it?" The professional draws a suppressed pistol.
**Victor's Final Thought**: He looks at the gun. He thinks about the 47 faces. He thinks about the 200 futures.
**The Calculation**: *ROI: Positive.*
**The Shot**: Darkness. Pain, then nothing. The cold, clean end of Victor Kaine, Executive.

### BRIDGE Beat 2: The Void (300-350 words)

**The Experience**: Not heaven. Not hell. A waiting room.
**The Audit**: A presence. Vast, bureaucratic, indifferent. The Galactic Audit Consortium (though he doesn't know the name yet).
**The Selection**: They are reviewing his file. Not his sins, but his *efficiency*. And that one anomaly. The data point that doesn't fit.
*Subject 8940. Trait: Ruthless Utility. Anomaly: Self-Termination for Zero Gain.*
*Assessment: Interesting.*
*Disposition: Reassign.*

### FLASHBACK Beat 3: The Awakening (400-450 words)

**Transition**: Pain returns. But different. Sharp. Cold. Stone under his back.
**The Dungeon**: The smell of damp earth. The dim light of a failing Dungeon Core (Core-7749/Nova before the upgrade).
**The Realization**: He isn't dead. He's... managed.
**First Action**: He doesn't scream. He checks his pockets. Finds his tie (ruined). Checks his pulse (present).
**The Goblin**: Sniv appears. A wretched, starving runt holding a rusty shank.
**The First Deal**: Sniv tries to rob him. Victor negotiates employment. The birth of "The Manager."

## Cliffhanger (200-250 words)

**SNAP BACK TO PRESENT**: The Core Chamber.
**Victor's Reaction**: He gasps. Physically staggers. The memory is fully integrated. He remembers the bullet. He remembers the Void. He remembers *why* he was chosen.
**The Revelation**: He wasn't saved. He was *hired*. The events on Earth weren't a tragedy; they were his interview.
**The Prince**: Nova alerts him. "ROYAL ENTOURAGE DETECTED. ESTIMATED ARRIVAL: 4 HOURS."
**Victor's State**: He straightens his jacket. The doubt is gone. The weakness is gone. He remembers who he is.
**Final Line**: "Let them come. I passed the interview. Let's see if the Prince can pass his performance review."
