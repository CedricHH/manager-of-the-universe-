# Outline: Chapter 118 - The Severance

**Word Target**: 1,800-2,000 words

## Continuity Verification
- [x] Kieran betrayal resolution (setup in Ch 117)
- [x] Internal coalition conflict (new tension)
- [x] Conflict type: Political/internal (varies from external warfare)

---

## Hook (250-350 words)

**Opening**: Night. Victor summons emergency meeting with Valorian and Morthane representatives. Kieran's betrayal evidence on display.

**Key Elements**:
- Encrypted intercepts proving Kieran sold defensive intelligence
- Coalition trust severely damaged
- 28 hours until main Revolutionary assault
- If Kieran isn't handled, coalition fractures

**Hook**: "House Kieran has committed breach of contract. The question is: what's the penalty?"

---

## Development (1,100-1,400 words)

### Beat 1: Coalition Fracture Risk (~400 words)
**The stakes**: If Victor accuses Kieran publicly, coalition could fracture. Other houses will see it as precedent—anyone could be accused.

**Lord Valorian's position**: "These are serious accusations. If true, Kieran must answer. If false, *you* must answer."

**Lady Morthane's position**: "We need proof beyond intercepts. Magical communication can be forged."

**Victor's approach**: "I don't want Kieran punished. I want Kieran *neutralized*. There's a difference."

**Proposal**: Private confrontation. Give Kieran chance to defect back. If refused, then public exposure.

### Beat 2: The Confrontation (~400 words)
**Setting**: Victor meets Captain Dren Kieran privately. Resh at door. No witnesses from other houses.

**Victor's opening**: "Captain Kieran. You sold our defensive positions to the Revolutionaries. I don't care why. I care what happens next."

**Kieran's defense**: "Proof?"

**Victor shows intercepts**: Undeniable.

**Kieran's calculation**: "What do you want?"

**Victor's terms**:
- Kieran feeds Revolutionary command *false* intelligence (defenses shifted to match)
- House Kieran contributes remaining mercenaries (committed, not "considering")
- No public exposure
- In exchange: Kieran retains 15% equity stake in recovered Bank (reduced from 25%)

**Kieran's counter**: "And if I refuse?"

**Victor**: "Then you leave this room with Resh, not with me."

**Beat**: Resh shifts weight. Kieran understands.

**Agreement**: Kieran accepts. False intelligence will be fed. Betrayal becomes double-cross.

### Beat 3: The False Intelligence (~400 words)
**Execution**: Kieran sends new message to Revolutionary command:
> "Coalition defenses restructured. Eastern approach reinforced. Northern approach now vulnerable. Revised attack recommendation: northern assault."

**Reality**: Victor *actually* reinforcements the northern approach. Revolutionary attack will hit the strongest point.

**Sera's confirmation**: "Message sent. Revolutionary command received. Formation adjustment... detected."

**Victor's satisfaction**: Kieran betrayal converted into tactical advantage.

**ARMI update**:
> **[ARMI: OPERATION MISDIRECTION]**
> False Intelligence: DELIVERED
> Revolutionary Response: FORMATION ADJUSTMENT CONFIRMED
> Northern Defenses: REINFORCED
> Projected Enemy Casualties: +2,300 (estimate)

**Complication**: Multi-front attacks beginning. Legitimists hit Thornfield Junction. Theocrats assault Solvara East. Revolutionary command receiving reports of attacks on three fronts.

---

## Cliffhanger (250-350 words)

**Strategic overview**: Victor's multi-front strategy activating.

**Sera's real-time updates**:
- Legitimists: Thornfield Junction under attack. Supply depot burning.
- Theocrats: Solvara East penetrated. Relic recovery in progress.
- Revolutionaries: Vex receiving reports of attacks. Must decide: continue Ironhold assault or defend rear.

**CLIMACTIC MOMENT**: Revolutionary army halts. 18 hours from Ironhold. Vex is splitting forces.

**ARMI update**:
> **[ARMI: ENEMY FORCE REDISTRIBUTION]**
> Revolutionary Army: SPLITTING
> Ironhold Assault Force: 15,000 (reduced from 25,000)
> Rear Guard/Counterattack: 10,000
> Assessment: PRESSURE RELIEVED

**Victor's reaction**: "15,000 is still 3:1 odds. But 3:1 is survivable. 6:1 wasn't."

**Final tension**: Kieran looks at Victor during celebration.

> "You're better at this than the previous teams. That's not a compliment. It means you're more dangerous. I'll work with you. But I won't forget this."

**Victor's response**: "I don't need you to forget. I need you to be *profitable*."

**Final ARMI Message**:
> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 5, HOUR 6]**
> **[MULTI-FRONT OPERATION: SUCCESS]**
> **[REVOLUTIONARY FORCE: REDUCED]**
> **[INTERNAL COALITION: STABILIZED (FRAGILE)]**
> **[MISSION CLOCK: 115 DAYS, 13 HOURS REMAINING]**

## Chapter Checklist

- [ ] Protagonist demonstrates competence (betrayal→double-cross conversion)
- [ ] Kieran confrontation resolved pragmatically
- [ ] Multi-front strategy pays off
- [ ] At least 2 ARMI system messages
- [ ] Corporate jargon ("breach of contract," "severance," "profitable")
- [ ] Cliffhanger creates tension (reduced but not eliminated threat)
- [ ] Mobile-optimized paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- [ ] Word count: 1,800-2,000

---

## Key Character Notes

**Victor**: Converts betrayal into advantage. Pragmatic—doesn't punish, leverages. Makes enemies who respect him.

**Kieran**: Forced double-cross. Will work with Victor but permanent tension established.

**Resh**: Silent threat. Physical backup for negotiation.

**Sera**: Intelligence confirmation. Verifies false intelligence success.

---

## Thematic Notes

Victor doesn't eliminate enemies—he converts them into assets. Kieran's betrayal becomes Revolutionary disadvantage. The cost is permanent distrust, but in war, pragmatic cooperation beats ideological purity.

**Key Line**: "Punishment wastes resources. Leverage creates value."
