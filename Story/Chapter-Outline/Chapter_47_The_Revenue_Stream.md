# Chapter 47: The Revenue Stream

## Chapter Goal
Establish the dungeon as a legitimate (if predatory) business entity. Implement the "Entry Fee" system and process the first paying customers.

## Characters
- **Victor**: The CEO. Focused on maximizing ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).
- **Valerius**: The Consultant. Nervous but providing the necessary bureaucratic cover.
- **Asterion**: Head of Security/Doorman. Enforcing the "No Ticket, No Entry" policy.
- **Sniv**: Customer Service. Handling waivers and upselling.
- **Random Adventurers**: The first customers/victims of the new business model.

## Plot Beats

### 1. The Setup (Hook)
- Victor and Valerius discussing the legal terminology of "Entry Fees" vs "Treasure Hunting Licenses".
- Valerius suggests "Hazard Pay Reverse-Indemnity Clauses".
- Victor loves it. It's evil and legal.

### 2. The Infrastructure
- Converting the dungeon entrance.
- Asterion is given a booth (or a rock with a sign).
- The sign: "INSOLVIA HOLDINGS: ADMITTANCE 5 SILVER. WAIVER REQUIRED."
- Sniv is dressed in a "uniform" (a clean rag tied like a tie).

### 3. The First Customers
- A party of novice adventurers arrives (The "Iron Boots" or generic low-level party).
- They expect a fight. They get a form.
- Confusion ensues. "You want us to... pay to raid you?"
- Victor explains the value prop: "Safe environment, guaranteed loot drops (for premium ticket holders), clean air."

### 4. The Upsell
- Victor upsells them on the "Silver Package" (includes a potion and a map of Floor 1).
- They actually buy it.
- ARMI registers the first legal revenue.
- Victor feels the rush of capitalism.

### 5. The Complication/Cliffhanger
- Business is booming (two parties).
- Then, a problem: The "Whales" arrive.
- A high-level, arrogant noble party (maybe connected to Sterling or a new antagonist).
- They refuse to pay. They threaten to burn the booth.
- Asterion steps forward. "Ticket, please."

## Key Dialogues
- Victor: "Adversaries are just customers with aggressive negotiation tactics."
- Valerius: "Technically, if they die after signing this, we own their equipment as probate processing fees."
- Adventurer: "Is this a dungeon or a toll road?"

## ARMI Updates
- **[Revenue Alert]**: First transaction recorded.
- **[Skill Unlock]**: `[Dynamic Pricing]` or `[Upsell]`.
