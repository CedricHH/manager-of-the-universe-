# Outline: Chapter 1 - Dead Capital

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 1,800 words
**Arc**: 1 (Dungeon)
**Position**: Opening chapter

---

## Opening Image

Victor Kaine wakes. Cold stone floor. Darkness. The stench of blood and torch smoke.

Next to him: a corpse in golden armor. Sword still in hand. Face frozen in surprise.

Whoever this was—expensive armor, glowing sword—he died looking surprised.

Victor's first thought: *Someone clearly overpaid for that equipment.*

---

## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Disorientation

Victor's consciousness returns in fragments:
- Physical: Pain (but not injured), cold, discomfort
- Mental: Something is wrong. This isn't the server room. This isn't the hospital.
- Memory: Fragments—the heart attack, the hard drive, a voice saying "PROCESSING..."

**Key line**: *He tried to check his pulse. His heart was beating. The last time he'd felt it, he was dying on a corporate carpet.*

### Beat 2: The Corpse

Victor notices the body. Assessment kicks in automatically:
- Young male (early 20s)
- Golden armor (expensive, ceremonial)
- Legendary sword (glowing faintly)
- Cause of death: Spike trap through chest

**Victor's thought**: *Whoever this was, he died because he didn't check for traps. Basic due diligence. Pathetic.*

### Beat 3: ARMI Activates

The system interface appears—blue, clinical, corporate.

> **[ARMI - APEX RESOURCE MANAGEMENT INTERFACE]**
> Welcome, Restructurer #8940.
> Previous operator: Marcus Valorheart (TERMINATED)
> Status: ASSET TRANSFER COMPLETE
> Warning: Zero capital. Insolvency imminent.

Victor doesn't panic. He reads the fine print.

---

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 4: System Tutorial (Involuntary)

Victor tries to dismiss the interface. ARMI provides mandatory orientation:

**Core Mechanics Shown**:
- Gold = Mana (interchangeable)
- Skills cost Gold to use
- Current balance: 0 GP
- Marcus's equipment: Soulbound (cannot loot directly)

**Victor's Frustration**:
> *A system with zero starting capital and no credit line. Who designed this? A government?*

**ARMI Response** (sardonic):
> The Galactic Audit Consortium does not provide startup loans.
> Recommendation: ASSET RECOVERY from available resources.

### Beat 5: Memory Fragment

While exploring the chamber, Victor's mind flashes:

*The Processing Queue. Geometric shapes judging him. A voice: "Candidate 8940. Profile: Efficiency 97th percentile. Empathy 3rd percentile. Recommendation: DEPLOYMENT."*

He shakes it off. Focus on the present. Analyze later.

### Beat 6: Inventory Assessment

Victor examines what's available:

| Item | Status | Value |
|------|--------|-------|
| Marcus's Sword | Soulbound (locked) | 0 GP |
| Marcus's Armor | Soulbound (locked) | 0 GP |
| Marcus's Backpack | Unlocked | Contains supplies |
| Victor's Clothes | Earth businesswear | Useless |
| The Chamber | Dungeon boss room | Real estate? |

**Backpack Contents**:
- 5 Health Potions (50 GP each if sold)
- Travel rations (3 days)
- Map (marked "Tutorial Dungeon - EASY")
- Hero's Letter (prophecy nonsense)

**ARMI Calculation**:
> Liquid assets: 250 GP equivalent
> Burn rate: Unknown
> Runway: Insufficient

### Beat 7: The Letter

Victor reads Marcus's prophecy letter:

> "Chosen One, the gods have selected YOU to save Terra-Insolvia from the Demon King. Proceed through the Trial Dungeon to receive your divine blessing. The path is easy. You cannot fail."

Victor's assessment: *He believed this. He walked into a dungeon, assumed it was "easy," and died to the first trap.*

**Key realization**: This world operates on narrative logic. Victor does not.

### Beat 8: First Skill Unlock

ARMI notifies:

> **[NEW SKILL AVAILABLE]**
> **Performance Review** (Passive)
> Cost: 0 GP
> Effect: Analyze target's stats, weaknesses, and market value.
> Note: Complimentary skill for new Restructurers.

Victor activates it on Marcus's corpse:

> **[PERFORMANCE REVIEW - Marcus Valorheart]**
> Level: 15
> Class: Chosen Hero
> Status: DECEASED
> Cause of Death: Overconfidence (critical failure)
> Remaining Value: Soul data (archived), Equipment (soulbound), Reputation (transferable?)
> Assessment: TERMINATED ASSET. Salvage recommended.

### Beat 9: Sound in the Distance

Victor hears something. Chittering. Movement. Multiple sources.

**ARMI Alert**:
> Proximity warning: Hostile entities approaching.
> Threat level: LOW (individually)
> Count: 12-15 units
> Type: Goblin (basic)
> Recommendation: Avoid engagement (0 GP reserves)

Victor looks around. No exits visible. The boss chamber has one door—and the sounds are coming from that direction.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 10: The Situation

Victor takes stock:
- Unarmed (sword is locked)
- No magic (no gold reserves)
- Zero combat training
- Twelve to fifteen hostiles incoming

**Standard response**: Panic.

**Victor's response**: *Analysis.*

He looks at Marcus's body again. The Hero came here alone, overconfident, and died.

Those goblins—they're not investigating a noise. They're coming to CLAIM something. The Hero's equipment. The dungeon's loot. Standard scavenger behavior.

They expect to find a corpse. They expect easy pickings.

They don't expect someone who reads contracts.

### Beat 11: The Plan Forms

Victor doesn't have weapons. He has something better.

**ARMI Query**: *Can I communicate with hostiles?*

> **[ARMI RESPONSE]**
> Goblins possess rudimentary language capabilities.
> Communication success rate: 23%
> Negotiation success rate: 4%
> Note: Goblins respond to clear hierarchy and food incentives.

Four percent. Terrible odds.

But Victor has closed worse deals.

### Beat 12: Final Line

The goblin pack bursts into the chamber. Crude weapons. Yellow eyes. Hungry.

They see Victor standing over the Hero's corpse. They see the golden armor, the glowing sword.

They smell weakness. They smell opportunity.

Victor straightens his tie. (He's still wearing his Earth suit. Force of habit.)

And he speaks:

> "Before you attack, I have a counter-offer."

The lead goblin hesitates. This isn't how prey behaves.

**ARMI notification**:
> Negotiation attempt initiated.
> Success probability: Calculating...

---

## Chapter End Hook

The goblins haven't attacked yet. Victor has maybe ten seconds.

He's standing in a dungeon, in a world he doesn't understand, with no weapon and no magic, facing a pack of monsters.

And he's about to offer them a job.
