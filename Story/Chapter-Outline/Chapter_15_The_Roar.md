## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Final Day

Victor wakes early.
He's barely slept in a week.
The dungeon is quiet. Too quiet.

He checks his assets:
- 26 goblins (Trained, organized)
- Iron weapons (Crude but functional)
- ~50 GP worth of goods
- 1 healing potion

Not enough to pay Asterion.
Not enough to fight him.

### Beat 2: The Waiting

Victor stations himself at the entrance.
He *needs* adventurers today.

Hours pass.
Sniv brings him food. He doesn't eat.

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Arrival

Midday.
**ARMI Alert**:
> Perimeter Activity.
> Entities: 4
> Classification: Adventurer Party (Mid-Level)
> Equipment: Standard Dungeon Gear

Victor's heart rate spikes.
They came.

### Beat 4: The Silver Lance

The party enters:
- **Gareth** (Tank, Lv 12)
- **Lysa** (Healer, Lv 10)
- **Finn** (Rogue, Lv 11)
- **Kaelie** (Mage, Lv 13)

They're cautious. Professional.
> Gareth: "The kids weren't lying. Goblins. Traps."
> Mira: "And that glow... there's a magic item here."

### Beat 5: The Gauntlet

Victor pulls back his forces.
He doesn't want to scare them off like the noobs.
He wants them to go *deep*.

The Silver Lance bypasses Floor 1 traps (They're experienced).
They clear Floor 2 slimes easily.
They reach Floor 3.

### Beat 6: The Decision Point

The glowing sword is right there.
Mira casts **[Identify]**.
> "Soulbound. Useless to us."

They're disappointed.
> Finn: "This is a waste. Let's go."

Victor panics. If they leave, nothing to give Asterion.
He needs them to go to Floor 4.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: THE ROAR

As the Silver Lance prepares to leave...
**THE DUNGEON SHAKES.**

A roar from below. Not distant this time.
**ASTERION.**

The stairs to Floor 4 crack open.
The Minotaur's voice echoes:
> "TIME'S UP, MANAGER."
> "BRING ME TRIBUTE... OR I COME FOR IT MYSELF."

The Silver Lance freezes.
> Gareth: "What the hell was that?"
> Mira: "A boss monster. Floor 4."
They look at each other.
> Finn: "That's... that's a REAL dungeon."
> Lysa: "We're not equipped for this."

They run.
But now they know: There's a **boss** here.
And bosses mean **epic loot**.

### Beat 8: The New Situation

Victor is alone with his goblins.
Asterion is coming up.
The adventurers fled.
Deadline: NOW.

Victor takes a deep breath.
He walks toward the stairs to Floor 4.
> "Stay here. All of you."
> Sniv: "Boss! Cow-man will kill!"
> Victor: "Maybe. But running won't help."

He descends.
Alone.
Unarmed.
To negotiate with a monster.

**END OF ACT 1.1**

## Checklist

- [x] **Climax**: Silver Lance arrives and flees
- [x] **Cliffhanger**: Asterion demands tribute (Deadline hit)
- [x] **Transition**: Setup for "The Minotaur Question" arc
- [x] **Character**: Victor choosing to face Asterion alone

---

## Notes for Writing

- **Tension**: This is the tensest chapter yet.
- **Asterion**: His voice should be MASSIVE. Primal. Terrifying.
- **Victor**: He's not brave. He's calculated. Running = death. Negotiating = slim chance.

**Status**: READY FOR WRITING
**Next Phase**: Ch 16-25 "The Minotaur Question"
