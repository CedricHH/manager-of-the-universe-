# Outline: Chapter 74 - The Phenomenon

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

## Hook (200-300 words)

Week 2 of the Ember Trials.

The tournament has exploded.

Twenty-three parties registered. Eighty-seven spectators. Merchants selling tournament-themed merchandise. Bards composing songs about Ignatia's defeats.

Oakhaven's weekly broadsheet runs a front-page story: **"Ember Trials: The New Gold Rush"**

But with visibility comes vultures.

Three guilds—Alchemist, Mercenary, and Merchant—each see opportunity.

And opportunity, in Oakhaven, means **hostile takeover**.

## Development

### Beat 1: The Phenomenon (350-450 words)

**Scene**: Dungeon entrance, Week 2 Day 1 (morning)
- Crowd chaos: 23 parties, 87 spectators, vendors selling "Ignatia Survivor" t-shirts
- Zip overwhelmed managing registrations
- Valerius reports: Tournament revenue projected at 6,800 GP this week

**Cultural Impact Evidence**:
- Children playing "dragon hunt" in streets
- Taverns showing projection screens (Victor licenses broadcast rights for 50 GP/tavern)
- Crimson Blades' winning time (24:17) is now Oakhaven folklore

**ARMI Projection**:
```
> **[ARMI]**
> Ember Trials - Week 2 Status
> Parties Registered: 23 (+8 from Week 1)
> Spectators: 87 (projected, capacity: 50)
> Broadcast Licenses: 4 taverns × 50 GP = 200 GP
> Total Projected Revenue: 6,800 GP
> Net Profit (after Community Fund): 5,620 GP
```

**Victor's Observation**: "We've created a brand. Brands attract competitors."

### Beat 2: The First Threat - Alchemist Guild (350-450 words)

**Scene**: Victor's office, afternoon
- Groll (Alchemist Guildmaster, former antagonist from Ch 42) arrives with "business proposal"
- He's recovered from previous defeat, now seeking **partnership** (changed strategy)

**Groll's Proposal**:
- "Exclusive potion supplier" contract for Ember Trials participants
- Revenue split: 60% Groll, 40% Victor
- Threat (veiled): "It would be... unfortunate if adventurers got sick before matches."

**Victor's Analysis**:
- Groll wants monopoly access to 23 parties/week
- Leverage: Potential sabotage of participants
- Counter-leverage: Victor has alternate suppliers (Merchant's Guild)

**Victor's Response**:
- "Counter-proposal: You supply potions at market rate + 10%. No exclusivity. No revenue split."
- Groll (angry): "That's insulting."
- Victor: "That's business. You're welcome to decline."

**Groll leaves, furious**

**ARMI Alert**:
```
> **[ARMI - THREAT DETECTED]**
> Alchemist Guild: Extortion attempt (potion monopoly)
> Threat Level: MODERATE
> Countermeasure: Diversified supply chain already established
> Recommendation: Monitor for sabotage attempts
```

### Beat 3: The Second Threat - Mercenary Guild (400-500 words)

**Scene**: Floor 5, evening exhibition match
- "Ironclad Company" (Mercenary Guild team) challenges Ember Trials
- They're Level 20+ (overqualified for current difficulty)
- Purpose: **Demonstrate tournament is "too easy"** to damage reputation

**The Fight**:
- Ironclad Company uses overwhelming force
- Defeats Ignatia in 14 minutes (new record, but unsportsmanlike)
- Crowd reacts negatively: "They're showing off." "That's not fair."

**Post-Match**:
- Mercenary Guildmaster Kael approaches Victor with "offer"
- "Partner with us. We provide 'elite difficulty' for premium customers. 70/30 split."
- **Real Goal**:Control tournament difficulty = control who wins = gambling opportunities

**Victor's Counter**:
- "Interesting. But I already control difficulty. Ignatia has ten difficulty tiers I haven't activated yet."
- Reveals: The dragon fight can scale from Level 15 (current) to Level 30+
- "If you want elite difficulty, I'll add it. But I don't need partners."

**Kael's Threat**:
- "Shame if our members stopped participating. Tournaments need competitors."
- Victor (calm): "I have twenty-three parties registered. Lose five, I still have eighteen. You need exposure. I provide it. Rethink your leverage."

**Kael leaves, calculating**

### Beat 4: The Third Threat - Merchant's Guild Pivot (300-400 words)

**Scene**: Late evening, Voros Thane (Merchant's Guildmaster, Victor's loan partner) visits

**Unexpected Twist**:
- Voros ISN'T threatening—he's **warning** Victor
- "The other guilds see your success and want in. But they're thinking small."
- "I'm thinking big. Franchise model."

**Voros's Proposal (Legitimate)**:
- Expand Ember Trials to other cities
- Merchant's Guild handles logistics, Victor provides tournament structure
- Revenue split: 50/50 (fair partnership)
- **Mutual benefit**: Victor scales income, Merchant's Guild gets exclusive transport/supply contracts

**Victor's Response**:
- Intrigued but cautious
- "I'll consider it. But Oakhaven stays mine. 100%."
- Voros: "Agreed. Expansion only."

**ARMI Analysis**:
```
> **[ARMI - OPPORTUNITY DETECTED]**
> Franchise Model: Ember Trials (Multiple Cities)
> Projected Revenue: +15,000 GP/month (5 cities × 3,000 GP average)
> Risk: Quality control, brand dilution
> Recommendation: Pilot program (1 city, 3 months)
```

## Cliffhanger (150-200 words)

Morning after the guild meetings.

Zip arrives with urgent news: **All 23 parties have withdrawn from today's tournament**.

Victor: "Explain."

Zip: "Anonymous letters. Sent to every registered party. Threats. 'Participate and face consequences.'"

Victor's mind races.

The guilds coordinated.

Instead of individual threats, they formed a **cartel**.

Alchemist + Mercenary + others = unified boycott.

No parties = no tournament = reputation damage.

Victor pulls up seating projections: 92 spectators expected today.

They'll arrive to an empty arena.

**ARMI Warning**:
```
> **[ARMI - CRISIS ALERT]**
> Tournament Boycott: Coordinated guild action
> Spectator Expectations: 92 attendees, zero content
> Reputation Risk: CRITICAL
> Revenue Loss: 3,400 GP (this week)
> Recommendation: EMERGENCY COUNTERMEASURES REQUIRED
```

**Final Line**: Victor stares at the empty registration board and says one word: "Escalate."

***

**STATUS**: Week 2 Ember Trials exploded in popularity (23 parties, 87 spectators, cultural phenomenon). Three guild th reats: Alchemist (potion monopoly attempt), Mercenary (elite difficulty extortion), Merchant (franchise opportunity - legitimate). Guilds coordinated boycott—all 23 parties withdrew. Crisis: 92 spectators expected, zero content. Emergency countermeasures required.
