## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Market Research

Victor uses upgraded ARMI to scan Oakhaven's potion market.

Current prices (Cartel-controlled):
- Basic Health Potion: 15 GP (cost to make: 2 GP)
- Mana Restoration: 20 GP (cost: 3 GP)
- Antidote: 25 GP (cost: 4 GP)

Victor calculates: 600-700% markup. Monopoly extraction.

### Beat 2: The Opening Move

Victor sends message to dungeon (via ARMI remote link to Nova):

"Increase slime core production 400%. Prepare shipment for Oakhaven delivery. Priority: quality-controlled reagents for potion base manufacturing."

Nova's response: "OPERATIONAL ADJUSTMENT CONFIRMED. ESTIMATED DELIVERY: 3 DAYS."

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Market Stall

Victor rents merchant stall in Oakhaven market square.

Simple setup: Professional signage, quality display cases, price boards prominently visible.

**Victor's Pricing**:
- Basic Health Potion: 5 GP (66% discount)
- Mana Restoration: 7 GP (65% discount)
- Antidote: 8 GP (68% discount)

Crowd gathers immediately. Adventurers check quality, compare prices, buy in bulk.

### Beat 4: First Day Results

Victor sells 40 potions in 3 hours.

Revenue: 240 GP (160 GP profit after cost/overhead)

Market disruption visible: Cartel stall across square sees 70% customer drop.

Zip (helping at stall): "Boss! Many customers! Much revenue! Very synergies!"

Victor: "Synergy, Zip. And yes. This is how you break monopolies."

### Beat 5: The Cartel Response

Cartel representative approaches Victor's stall.

Man in expensive robes. Alchemist Guild badge. Condescending tone.

Cartel Rep: "You're selling below cost. That's illegal dumping. The Alchemist Guild will file complaint with city authorities."

Victor: "I'm selling at 250% markup. Want to see my cost documentation? Or would you prefer I explain to those adventurers why your prices are 700% markup?"

Cartel Rep (threatens): "You're making enemies. Dangerous ones."

Victor: "I'm making customers. Profitable ones. Different business model."

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 6: Evening Assessment

Victor closes stall. Day 1 success.

ARMI calculates: At current sales velocity, Cartel loses 30% market share within 2 weeks.

But trouble brewing...

### Beat 7: The Sabotage

Next morning: Victor's stall vandalized.

Inventory smashed. Signage destroyed. Message painted: "LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN."

Professional work. Hired thugs, not random vandalism.

Victor examines damage. Not angry. Calculating.

This confirms: Cartel fights dirty. Elena was right.

Victor to Zip: "Document everything. Take detailed notes. The Guild will want evidence."

New plan forming: Turn sabotage into legal advantage.

Victor sends message to Elena: "Cartel responded. Exactly as predicted. Moving to Phase 2."
