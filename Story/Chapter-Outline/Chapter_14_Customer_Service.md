## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Encounter

The two adventurers (Let's call them **Tom** and **Jerry**) enter Floor 1.
They're excited. Nervous.
> Tom: "This is it! The haunted temple!"
> Jerry: "That glow... you see it?"

They spot Marcus's sword in the distance.

### Beat 2: The Welcome

Victor's goblins are in position.
Rule: No killing. Only scaring.
They let the adventurers get to Floor 2.

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Scare

Tom reaches for a mushroom.
A goblin drops from the ceiling, screaming.
Tom screams back.
Jerry swings his sword wildly—misses.
The goblin runs into the darkness.

The adventurers are shaking.
> Jerry: "T-there are monsters!"
> Tom: "The sword... we can still get it..."

### Beat 4: Escalation

They push to Floor 3.
Victor triggers a trap (A swinging log—non-lethal).
It clips Jerry. He goes down.
Tom drags him back.

Goblins surround them (Making noise, not attacking).

### Beat 5: The Retreat

Tom and Jerry flee.
They drop their backpacks.
They run screaming into the forest.

**Loot Acquired**:
- 2 cheap swords (Iron)
- 1 healing potion (Basic)
- 3 gold coins
- A diary

Victor opens the diary.
It mentions: "Going to prove ourselves at the old temple."
And: "Meeting the Silver Lance party next month to apply for membership."

### Beat 6: The Intel

**Silver Lance**: A higher-level party.
If Tom and Jerry spread the story, better adventurers will come.
But Victor needs them to *survive* to spread it.

> "Let them go. They're our marketing department now."

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Report

Days pass.
Sniv reports from outside:
> "Town talking. 'Two boys survived the temple.' 'Saw goblins.' 'Saw glowing treasure.'"
> "Adventurers interested."

### Beat 8: The Timeline

Victor checks the calendar (Scratch marks on a wall).
Day 6 of Asterion's extension.
1 day left.
Adventurers are interested... but none have arrived yet.

If no one comes by tomorrow, Victor has to face Asterion with nothing.

> "Sniv. Any word on when the adventurers come?"
> Sniv: "Guild meeting today. Decision tomorrow."

Tomorrow. Everything hinges on tomorrow.
