# Outline: Chapter 120 - The Ledger

**Word Target**: 1,800-2,000 words

## Continuity Verification
- [x] Post-siege assessment (logical follow-up to Ch 119)
- [x] Bank exploration (Dravik trust payoff from Ch 114)
- [x] Conflict type: Economic/strategic planning (varies from military combat)

---

## Hook (250-350 words)

**Opening**: Three days after siege lifted. Ironhold recovering. Victor stands before the Central Bank vault doors with Dravik. First time Consortium agent allowed *inside* the Bank itself.

**Key Elements**:
- 890 coalition casualties, 4,200 Revolutionary casualties (decisive ratio)
- Legitimists holding Thornfield—Revolutionary supplies disrupted
- Theocrats retreated with recovered relics—but Solvara East damaged
- 72-hour breathing room becoming strategic planning window

**Hook**: "The siege is over. The real work begins."

## Development (1,100-1,400 words)

### Beat 1: Inside the Vault (~400 words)
**Visual**: Massive underground complex. Not just gold—archives extending into darkness. Pre-war records covering centuries of Terra-Solvaris civilization.

**Dravik's tour**:
- **Gold Reserves**: 16.7M GP in standardized bars (Consortium recovery target)
- **Land Registry**: Property deeds for 80% of habitable Terra-Solvaris
- **Noble Genealogies**: Legitimate succession records (provides legitimacy to factions)
- **Trade Agreements**: Pre-war international contracts (still technically valid)
- **Currency Printing Rights**: Whoever controls Bank controls money supply

**Victor's realization**: "This isn't a bank. It's a *civilization backup*. Whoever controls this can rebuild—or reshape—Terra-Solvaris entirely."

**ARMI revaluation**:
> **[ARMI: ASSET ASSESSMENT REVISED]**
> Central Bank Tangible Assets: 16.7M GP
> Central Bank Intangible Assets: 847M GP (estimated reconstruction value)
> Status: STRATEGIC VALUE EXCEEDS MONETARY VALUE

### Beat 2: The Coalition Position (~400 words)
**Strategic assessment**: Victor reviews faction status with Sera.

**Current standings**:
- **Warlords** (Dravik): Ironhold held, Bank secured, coalition leadership
- **Merchant Coalition**: 4,000 mercenaries committed, supplies flowing, Kieran under control
- **Legitimists**: Thornfield Junction captured, supplies secured, no formal alliance
- **Theocrats**: Relics recovered, withdrew to Cathedral District, unstable
- **Revolutionaries**: Army split, capital damaged, momentum lost—but still largest force

**Victor's analysis**: "Revolution still has 25,000 troops. We have 6,000. But we have *leverage*. They have ideology."

**Strategic options presented**:
1. **Defensive**: Fortify Ironhold, wait for Revolutionary collapse
2. **Diplomatic**: Formal alliance with Legitimists/Theocrats (risk: share power)
3. **Economic**: Use Bank assets to hire mercenaries, buy Revolutionary defectors
4. **Offensive**: Strike Revolutionary leadership while army divided

**Victor's recommendation**: "Option 3 with elements of 2. Buy, don't fight. Make defection profitable."

### Beat 3: The Defector Program (~400 words)
**Proposal to Dravik**: Use Bank funds to pay Revolutionary soldiers to defect.

**Economics**:
- Average Revolutionary soldier earns: 15 GP/month (often unpaid)
- Defection bonus: 200 GP + guaranteed employment
- Cost to flip 5,000 soldiers: ~1M GP
- Benefit: Reduce Revolutionary army by 20%, gain 5,000 experienced troops

**Dravik's objection**: "Mercenaries are unreliable."

**Victor**: "Mercenaries are *transactional*. Revolutionary soldiers are ideological—until they're hungry. Hungry soldiers become transactional very quickly."

**Implementation**:
- Sera creates propaganda network (defection offers via magical communication)
- Kieran's arms network repurposed for recruitment channels
- First defector targets: Non-ideological units (supply, logistics, rear guard)

**ARMI projection**:
> **[ARMI: DEFECTOR PROGRAM ESTIMATE]**
> Investment: 1M GP (Phase 1)
> Projected Defections: 4,000-7,000 troops
> Revolutionary Force Reduction: 15-25%
> Timeline: 30 days

## Cliffhanger (250-350 words)

**Consortium check-in**: Kira contacts Victor via ARMI emergency channel.

> "Victor. Day 6 report requested. Status?"

**Victor's response**: "Ironhold secured. Coalition formed. Bank accessed. Revolutionary army reduced by 4,200 casualties, split across three fronts. Defector program initiating."

**Kira's assessment**: "Impressive. Previous teams never survived first contact. Board is... watching."

**Warning**: "Rivals are concerned. Your success makes other Restructurers look inefficient. Expect... competition."

**Victor**: "Competition from who?"

**Kira**: "Other Consortium interests. Not everyone wants you to succeed. Some prefer failure they can explain over success that threatens their position."

**CLIFFHANGER**: Victor isn't just fighting five factions on Terra-Solvaris. He's now a threat within the Consortium itself. Someone *inside* might want him to fail.

**Final ARMI Message**:
> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 6]**
> **[COALITION STATUS: STABLE]**
> **[DEFECTOR PROGRAM: INITIATING]**
> **[INTERNAL CONSORTIUM ADVISORY: COMPETITORS DETECTED]**
> **[MISSION CLOCK: 114 DAYS REMAINING]**

## Key Character Notes

## Thematic Notes

This chapter marks transition from immediate survival to long-term strategy. Victor's skills (economic warfare, institutional manipulation) become primary again. The Bank isn't just gold—it's civilization leverage. Victor sees path to not just recovering the Bank, but reshaping Terra-Solvaris entirely.

**Key Line**: "They're fighting for territory. I'm restructuring an entire civilization. Same skills, different scale."
