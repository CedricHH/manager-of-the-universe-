# Outline: Chapter 63 - The Gilded Ledger

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

## Hook
Victor enters the **Gilded Ledger** (the Bank). It's not a building; it's a cathedral of wealth. Gold leaf, silent clerks, the smell of old paper.
Valerius is sweating. "Boss, this place... they own the King."
Victor: "Good. Then we're speaking to the manager."

## Development
### Beat 1: The Meeting
They meet **Director Malcom**, a high-elf who hasn't blinked in a century.
Malcom lays out the offer: A 50,000 GP loan.
The catch: **30% Equity** in Insolvia Holdings.
Meaning: The Bank gets a seat on the board. They get to veto Victor's decisions.
Victor refuses equity. "I don't sell pieces of myself."

### Beat 2: The Counter-Offer
Malcom threatens to fund Victor's competitors (The Guild).
Victor counters with a new financial product: **Loot Futures**.
"Don't invest in the company. Invest in the *yield*."
He proposes selling shares of future loot drops. The Bank gets a cut of every sword and potion dropped, but zero control over operations.
It's risky (for the Bank), but potentially infinite ROI.

### Beat 3: Due Diligence
Malcom is intrigued but skeptical. "How can you guarantee yield stability? The Paladin at your door is hurting traffic."
Victor reveals his "Security Rebranding" data (from Ch 62). Traffic is recovering, and the "Penance Special" is attracting a new demographic: Wealthy Sinners.
He shows the "Shadow-Audit" projections (ARMI generated).
Malcom agrees to a "Pilot Tranche." 10,000 GP now. If yield hits targets, they unlock 100,000 GP.

## Cliffhanger
Victor leaves with a heavy sack of gold (or a letter of credit).
Valerius is celebrating.
Victor is somber.
**Victor**: "We didn't just get a loan, Valerius. We just invited the sharks into the pool."
As they leave, we see Malcom open a secret file. It contains a report from **Aurelia**. The Church and Bank are sharing data.
**Status**: Funded, but the web is tightening.

## Checklist
- [ ] Describe the Bank as a temple of capitalism
- [ ] Establish Malcom as a cold, mathematical antagonist (High Elf)
- [ ] Explain "Loot Futures" simply
- [ ] Reveal the Church-Bank connection
