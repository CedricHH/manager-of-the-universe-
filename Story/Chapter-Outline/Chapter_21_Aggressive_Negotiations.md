The Silver Lance sees Victor.
A human. In a dungeon. Dressed in... is that a suit?
> Gareth: "Who the hell are you?"
> Victor: "The Manager."

### Beat 2: Confusion

The party draws weapons.
> Alara: "He's controlling the dungeon? A human?"
> Finn: "Necromancer? Demon in disguise?"

Victor raises his hands.
> "I'm neither. I'm just... management."

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Negotiation

Victor proposes a deal:
> "You want the treasure. The glowing sword."
> "I want... something else."
> "What if we made an arrangement?"

Mira is suspicious.
> "What kind of arrangement?"
> Victor: "You fight the boss. If you win, take everything."
> "If you lose... well, you won't care."

### Beat 4: The Catch

> Gareth: "And what do YOU get?"
> Victor: "Entertainment."

He gestures to the stairs.
> "There's a Minotaur down there. Level 25. He's bored."
> "I promised him worthy opponents."
> "You look worthy enough."

### Beat 5: Skill Unlock

Victor activates a new negotiation tactic.
He doesn't lie. He presents **options**.
> "Option A: Fight me and my 26 goblins. You win, but you're exhausted."
> "Option B: Fight the Minotaur fresh. Higher chance of glory."

**ARMI Alert**:
> **[Aggressive Negotiations]** Conditions Met.
> Skill Unlocked.
> Effect: Forces target to choose between presented options. Neither option is "good."

### Beat 6: The Choice

The party debates.
> Alara: "If there's a level 25 boss, this dungeon is official."
> Bron: "I came to fight. Let's fight the big one."

They choose Option B.
Victor smiles.
> "Excellent. The Minotaur is waiting."
