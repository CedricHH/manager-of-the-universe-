# Outline: Chapter 43 - Hostile Takeover Protocols

**Word Target**: 1500-2000

## Hook
Victor, Kael, and Mira arrive back at the Dungeon entrance (the disguised cave near Oakhaven). The mood is grim. Victor doesn't go to sleep; he calls an immediate emergency board meeting.
"Wake them up. All of them. Even the slime."

## Development
### Beat 1: The Briefing
The team assembles in the Core Room. Sniv (sleepy), Asterion (alert), Kael & Mira (confused by the dungeon interior), and Nova (The Core).
Victor outlines the situation: "The Alchemist Guild knows. They have declared intent to acquire this asset. We are shifting from 'stealth mode' to 'fortification mode'."
Kael and Mira are shocked to realize they are now working for a Dungeon Lord, but Victor spins it: "You are working for a sovereign corporation defending itself from a monopoly."
He offers them a new contract: Hazard Pay + Equity. They accept (Kael for the challenge, Mira for the money).

### Beat 2: The Audit (Defense Review)
Victor reviews the dungeon's defenses with Asterion.
Current status: Good for adventurers, bad for armies.
The "Kill Box" strategy isn't enough. They need "Attrition Warfare."
Victor authorizes the "Budget Unlock": He pours his liquid capital (800+ GP) into Nova.
Nova evolves/upgrades. New room types available: *Poison Gas Chamber*, *Gravity Trap*.

### Beat 3: The Economic Shield
Victor knows swords won't be enough. He needs a political shield.
He dictates a letter to Lord Sterling (his business partner).
"Invoking the aggressive defense clause of our partnership. I need your private militia on the border. In exchange, I offer you 5% more equity."
He also messages Elena Cross (Merchant Guild). He doesn't ask for help; he notifies her of "potential market volatility" due to Groll's "illegal aggression."

### Beat 4: The Slime Production Line
Sniv suggests using the potion slimes as weapons.
Victor realizes: "We don't just sell potions. We control the supply."
He orders a change in the slime diet. Feed them... alchemical waste. Turn them into *Acid Slimes* for defense, then revert them for production. Two-way asset utility.

## Cliffhanger
Morning comes. A scout (Zip) reports movement in the forest.
Not the Royal Army. Not the City Guard.
Mercenaries. "The Black Talons"—Groll's off-the-books wetwork team.
Victor watches them on the ARMI screen.
"They aren't here to arrest us," Victor says. "They're here to liquidate us."
He turns to Asterion.
"Show them why we don't do unpaid overtime."

## Checklist
- [ ] Reveal Dungeon to Kael/Mira
- [ ] Upgrade Dungeon defenses (Spending capital)
