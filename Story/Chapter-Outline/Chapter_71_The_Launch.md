# Outline: Chapter 71 - The Launch

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

---

## Hook (200-300 words)

The first Ember Trials poster goes up in Oakhaven's Adventurer District at dawn. By midday, twelve parties have registered. By sunset, the Gilded Ledger's Director Malcom is reading the same poster with visible anger.

Victor watches from his office as the registration queue grows. This isn't just another floor—it's the beginning of turning the dungeon into entertainment infrastructure.

## Development

### Beat 1: Registration Day (350-450 words)

**Scene**: Dungeon entrance, registration desk (Zip managing sign-ups)
- Twelve parties register for the inaugural Ember Trials
- Mix of experienced (Crimson Blades returning) and ambitious newcomers
- Tension builds: parties sizing each other up
- Entry fee: 50 GP per party (600 GP immediate revenue)
- Victor's observation: "They're paying me to compete for my prize money"

**ARMI Integration**:
```
> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: Registration Fees (12 parties × 50 GP)
> Revenue: 600 GP | Cost: 500 GP prize pool
> Net Profit: 100 GP (before spectator revenue)
```

**Key Character Moment**: 
- Crimson Blades' leader Theron comments: "This is brilliant. You weaponized our competitive instincts."
- Victor: "I prefer 'monetized.'"

### Beat 2: The First Trial Run (450-550 words)

**Scene**: Floor 5 observation room / Arena
- Spectator system activated (50 GP per seat, magical projection screens)
- First party enters: "The Iron Hammers" (mid-tier, overconfident)
- They underestimate Ignatia's Phase 2 transition
- Wipe at 60% boss health
- Crowd reacts with gasps, cheers, critique
- Leaderboard updates: "Iron Hammers - FAILED - 18:42 runtime"

**Victor's Analysis**:
- 8 spectators × 50 GP = 400 GP
- For a *failed* run
- Calculates potential: 12 parties × average 6 spectators each = 72 spectator seats
- Projected spectator revenue alone: 3,600 GP

**Key Insight**: "They're not just paying to play. They're paying to watch each other fail."

### Beat 3: The Breakthrough Run (400-500 words)

**Scene**: Crimson Blades' turn
- Professional execution, crowd favorite
- Strategic use of environmental hazards
- Ignatia forced into Phase 3 (Inferno Burst)
- They win with 43 HP remaining across party
- Time: 24 minutes, 17 seconds
- Crowd erupts
- Leaderboard: "Crimson Blades - VICTORY - 24:17"

**Prize Ceremony**:
- Victor personally hands Theron the 500 GP prize
- "Congratulations. You've earned the right to be hunted."
- Theron: "Hunted?"
- Victor: "Every party here now knows your time. And they'll be back."

**ARMI Update**:
```
> **[ARMI]**
> Ember Trials - Week 1, Day 1
> Revenue: 1,000 GP (Entries) + 600 GP (Spectators) = 1,600 GP
> Costs: 500 GP (Prize) + 50 GP (Operations) = 550 GP
> Net Profit: 1,050 GP
> Projection: 4,200 GP/month (sustainable model achieved)
```

### Beat 4: Malcom's Response (300-400 words)

**Scene**: Bank of Gilded Ledger, Malcom's office
- Malcom receives intelligence report about the tournament
- Realizes Victor's revenue model just became antifragile
- The dungeon is no longer dependent on loan revenue
- Key line: "He's not just running a dungeon. He's created a self-sustaining revenue engine."
- Malcom's decision: "Accelerate the plan. I want options on my desk by morning."

**Foreshadowing**: 
- Malcom orders surveillance increased
- Mentions "the Church option"
- Final note: "If I can't profit from him, I'll make sure no one does."

## Cliffhanger (150-200 words)

Victor returns to his office after the successful first trials. Valerius (double agent) delivers an urgent report:

- 3 different Guild scouts were spotted in the crowd
- Merchant's Guild (expected)
- Alchemist's Guild (hostile, seeking revenge)
- **Unknown third party** with Church of Eternal Light insignia

Victor's analysis:
- The Ember Trials succeeded *too well*
- High visibility = high risk
- The dungeon just became a strategic asset to multiple factions

**ARMI Warning**:
```
> **[ARMI - ALERT]**
> Risk Assessment: Multiple hostile acquisitions detected
> Recommendation: Diversify defensive protocols
> New Skill Available: [Reputation Management]
```

Victor stares at the leaderboard projection.

"We wanted attention. Seems we got it."

**Final Line**: A sealed letter arrives via magical courier—Church of Eternal Light seal. Subject line: "Invitation to Audit."
