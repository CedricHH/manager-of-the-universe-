## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: Day 2

Victor wakes to chaos.
Two goblins are fighting over a mushroom.
Blood. Screaming.
The night watch (one goblin) is asleep.

**Problem**: No enforcement. No consequences.

### Beat 2: The HR Problem

Victor separates the fighters.
He doesn't punish them physically (he can't).
He uses **deprivation**.
> "No dinner tonight. Both of you."

They don't understand the words. But they understand hunger.
The other goblins watch. Learning.

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Org Chart

Victor gathers all 14 goblins.
He draws on the wall with charcoal:
- **Boss**: Victor (Top)
- **Manager**: Sniv (Victor's direct report)
- **Workers**: Everyone else

He points at Sniv.
> "Sniv speaks for me. Disobeying Sniv = disobeying Boss."

Sniv puffs up. He's never had authority.
The goblins grumble but accept.

### Beat 4: Department Creation

Victor divides the workers:
- **Food Team** (4 goblins): Hunt slimes, gather mushrooms
- **Guard Team** (4 goblins): Watch the stairs, rotate shifts
- **Labor Team** (4 goblins): Clean, carry, build

Each team has a "Lead" (the biggest goblin in the group).
They don't have names. Victor assigns numbers.
> "You are Guard-1," "Food-2," etc.

### Beat 5: The First Schedule

Victor draws a crude clock on the wall (candle-marks).
> "Work 8 marks. Rest 4 marks. Eat 2 marks. Repeat."

The goblins don't understand "8."
Sniv translates: "Work until tired. Rest until not tired. Eat when Boss says."

### Beat 6: Sniv's Promotion Details

Victor sits with Sniv privately.
> "You count the food. You report problems. You don't hit anyone."
> "If they don't listen, you tell me. I hit them."

Sniv nods seriously.
> "Sniv is... what word? Middleman?"
> Victor: "Manager."
> Sniv: "Ma-na-ger. Sniv likes."

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Census Problem

Sniv reports the numbers:
- 14 goblins (loyal-ish)
- 28 hostile goblins on Floors 1-3 (Sniv's original count)

**Problem**: The hostile goblins are raiding the mushroom patches.
Food supply is threatened.

### Beat 8: The Expansion Decision

Victor has a choice:
1. Defend (Stay on Floor 5, starve slowly)
2. Expand (Take Floor 3, risk war)

He looks at his 14 goblins. Underfed. Undertrained.
But he has one advantage: **Organization**.

> "Tomorrow, we take Floor 3."
