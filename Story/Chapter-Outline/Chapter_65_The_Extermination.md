# Outline: Chapter 65 - The Extermination

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

---

## Hook (200-300 words)

Victor stands in the observation deck, staring at the golden mosquitoes through a magnifying glass. Valerius calculates the loss: each mosquito is draining approximately 0.03% of the dungeon's mana per hour. At current infestation levels, they're bleeding 12 GP/day—compounding.

Victor: "They're not just monitoring. They're *extracting*. The Bank embedded living auditors into my infrastructure."

Roland (who's been watching from below) shouts up: "Are those unlicensed magical constructs?"

Victor realizes: The Bank violated its own compliance rules. The parasites are illegal surveillance.

**Opening tension**: Victor has leverage—but killing the mosquitoes might trigger early loan repayment.

## Development

### Beat 1: The Investigation (400 words)

Victor orders a capture operation. Sniv uses a net, Gorg tries to clap one out of the air, Valerius attempts a tracking spell.

They capture one mosquito. Valerius dissects it (magically).

Discovery:
- The mosquito has a **mana signature** linked to the Bank of Oakhaven
- It's programmed to:
  1. Extract 0.5% of all generated wealth (interest)
  2. Report location/profitability to the Bank
  3. **Self-destruct if tampered with** (triggering loan default clause)

"It's a dead-man's switch," Valerius whispers. "If we kill them all, Malcom can claim breach of contract."

Victor: "Then we don't kill them. We *renegotiate their terms of employment*."

### Beat 2: The Bureaucratic Solution (500 words)

Victor calls Roland over.

"Officer, I need to file a complaint. These creatures are unlicensed magical constructs operating within a regulated dungeon. Under the Magical Pest Control Act of 1447, I have the right to relocate invasive species."

Roland pulls out his compliance manual. He reads. He frowns.

"You're right. These are Class-C Magical Vermin. You are required to contain them and submit a Pest Control Form 38-B within 72 hours."

Victor: "And if the Bank objects?"

Roland: "The Bank does not supersede Crown Law."

Victor drafts a counter-proposal:
- He won't kill the mosquitoes
- He'll relocate them to a "designated monitoring zone" (a tiny glass jar)
- They can still *technically* monitor, but they can't skim mana
- Any objection from the Bank = admission they planted illegal surveillance

He sends the proposal via magical pigeon to Malcom.

### Beat 3: The Bank's Response (400 words)

12 hours later, a formal letter arrives.

From: **Malcom, Senior Loans Officer**
Subject: **Re: Pest Relocation Notice**

> *Mr. Kaine,*
> 
> *Your complaint has been reviewed. The "Financial Monitoring Sprites" were installed per standard operating procedure. However, we acknowledge certain... territorial compliance issues.*
> 
> *We propose: Reduce sprite population by 80%. Remaining 20% will monitor only, with no extraction capability.*
> 
> *In exchange, we waive the first quarter's compound interest (500 GP savings).*
> 
> *Do we have an accord?*

Victor reads it twice. "He blinked."

Valerius is shocked. "The Bank... negotiated?"

Victor: "He had to. If this went to Crown Court, the Church would have used it as precedent to audit *every* Bank loan for illegal magical surveillance. Malcom chose to cut his losses."

Victor accepts. The mosquito population drops to manageable levels. The remaining ones are non-extractive (Roland inspects them personally).

## Cliffhanger (200 words)

That night, as Victor inventories the captured mosquitoes, Valerius notices something.

"Boss... the dead ones. They didn't self-destruct."

Victor examines a corpse. Inside its abdomen: a tiny, crystallized mana core. It's worth about 5 GP.

"They were never just parasites," Victor realizes. "They were also... *loot*."

He does the math. 80 mosquitoes x 5 GP = 400 GP.

The Bank didn't just skim his profits. They accidentally gave him a renewable resource.

"Sniv," Victor calls. "Start a mosquito farm. If the Bank wants to plant money-bugs in my dungeon, I'm going to *harvest them*."

As Sniv starts building cages, a new magical pigeon lands.

The message is short:

> *"Clever. But you just made it personal.*
> *- M."*

Victor crumples the note.

"Good. Personal is profitable."
