## Hook (200-300 words)

### Beat 1: The Battle Begins

Asterion charges.
His axe swings.
Gareth blocks—barely. His shield cracks.
> "Holy shit, he's FAST!"

Victor watches from the arena's edge.
**Observation Mode**: He's learning how high-level combat works.

### Beat 2: Team Tactics

The Silver Lance coordinates:
- Gareth (Tank) holds the line
- Bron (Berserker) flanks
- Mira (Mage) casts from range
- Finn (Rogue) looks for openings
- Lysa (Healer) keeps them alive
- Alara (Paladin) buffs and smites

## Development (1,000-1,200 words)

### Beat 3: The Reality Check

Asterion isn't just strong. He's **experienced**.
- He baits Bron into overextending, then stomps him
- He charges through Mira's fireballs (Magic Resistance)
- He catches Finn mid-backstab and throws him into a wall

**Victor's Analysis (ARMI)**:
> Silver Lance Team Power: ~70
> Asterion Power: 90
> Probability of Victory: 12%

### Beat 4: The Turning Point

Alara casts **[Holy Smite]**.
It hits Asterion. He roars. He *bleeds*.
> "Divine magic? You brought a priest?"

He focuses on Alara.
She can hurt him.
The dynamic shifts.

### Beat 5: Lysa Falls

Asterion ignores the tank.
He charges Lysa (The healer).
Gareth can't intercept in time.
Lysa goes down. Hard.
> "LYSA!"

**Party Status**: Healer incapacitated. 15 minutes tops.

### Beat 6: Victor's Dilemma

The fight is tilting toward Asterion.
If Silver Lance dies, Asterion is satisfied.
But Victor needs survivors to *spread the word*.

---

## Cliffhanger (200-300 words)

### Beat 7: The Injured Retreat

> Gareth: "FALL BACK! GRAB LYSA!"
The party breaks.
Finn grabs Lysa. They run for the stairs.
Asterion doesn't chase.
> "Running? Disappointing."

### Beat 8: Victor's Intervention

The party reaches the stairs.
Victor steps in their path.
> "Leaving so soon?"
> Gareth (Furious): "Get out of the way or I'll kill you!"

Victor doesn't move.
> "She needs healing. Divine healing."
> "Your paladin is exhausted."
> "I have... options."

He holds up a healing potion.
The only one he has.
> "Price: Everything you know about the Adventurer's Guild."
