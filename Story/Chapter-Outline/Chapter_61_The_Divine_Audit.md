# Outline: Chapter 61 - The Divine Audit

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

## Hook
The heavy iron door to the Core Room explodes. Not shattered—*erased*. Aurelia stands in the debris, her staff glowing with white fire.
**Aurelia**: "Behold the heart of the cancer."
Behind her, Prince Aldric looks annoyed (mostly about the dust on his suit).

## Development
### Beat 1: The Accusation
Aurelia enters the Core Room. It is humming with purple energy. Nova (the Core) is exposed.
Aurelia raises her staff. "A World Core. Forbidden by the First Edict. It must be purged."
She begins casting a Level 40 **[Holy Nova]**.
Victor steps in front. "Stop. You are damaging critical infrastructure."
Aurelia: "I am saving the world from a parasite."

### Beat 2: The Asset Protection
Victor cannot stop her with force. He turns to Aldric.
**Victor**: "Your Highness. That 'parasite' prints the money. If she breaks it, your 15% revenue stream vanishes. Forever."
Aldric does the math instantly.
The Prince steps between Aurelia and the Core.
**Aldric**: "High Priestess. Stand down."

### Beat 3: Church vs. State
The tension spikes. Aurelia can kill them all, but attacking the Crown Prince is civil war.
**Aurelia**: "You defend this? It is Heresy."
**Aldric**: "It is a Royal Asset. I have just chartered it. Destroying Crown Property is treason."
Aurelia holds the spell... and then cancels it.
The backlash cracks the floor.

## Cliffhanger
Aurelia walks up to Victor. She is terrifyingly calm.
**Aurelia**: "The Prince protects you today. But he is mortal. And he is greedy. One day, he will slip. And I will be there."
She leaves. But she doesn't leave the dungeon. She stations a "Church Observer" (Paladin) at the entrance.
**Status**: The Dungeon survived, but now the Church is watching 24/7.
**Nova**: "That woman is scary. Can we eat her?"
**Victor**: "Not yet."
