# Outline: Chapter 44 - Liquidation Event

**Word Target**: 1500-2000

## Hook
The Black Talons breach the entrance. They are professional. They check for traps. They disarm the basic tripwires.
Victor watches on the screen. "They are following standard dungeon delving protocols. Good."
He turns to Sniv. "Introduce them to the new safety regulations."

## Development
### Beat 1: The Ventilation Audit
The mercenaries move through the first corridor. It looks clear.
Sniv gives the signal. The "Acid Slimes" (fed on waste) are released into the overhead ventilation shafts.
They don't attack directly; they drip. A corrosive rain.
Armor sizzles. Panic ensues. It's not a fight; it's an environmental disaster.
The mercenaries are forced to burn precious defensive scrolls just to survive the hallway.
Victor: "Cost of entry just went up by 500 gold per head."

### Beat 2: The Kill Box (Kael's Command)
Survivors push through to the first large chamber.
Kael is waiting. He has organized the goblins into a Roman-style testudo formation (shields locked).
The mercenaries laugh at goblins holding shields—until they realize the floor is greased with slime residue.
The mercenaries slip. The goblins hold ground. Kael leads a precise, discipline counter-attack.
Kael: "Hold the line! They are billing by the hour; we are fighting for equity!"

### Beat 3: The Boss Monster (Asterion)
The Black Talon Captain (Level 18) pushes past Kael, aiming for the Core Room.
He meets Asterion in the central hub.
It's a duel. The Captain expects a brute beast. Asterion fights like a tank—using cover, parrying, maximizing efficiency.
Asterion pins the Captain. "You are trespassing on private property."

## Cliffhanger
The Captain is defeated but not dead. He reveals a secondary objective: They didn't just come to kill. They planted "Mana Spikes" at the entrance.
The spikes activate. They are disrupting the Core. Nova screams.
Groll's plan wasn't just liquidation; it was a hostile takeover of the *frequency*. He's trying to hijack the Core remotely.
Victor: "He's hacking us."
Victor realizes he can't just defend. He has to counter-attack the signal.

## Checklist
- [x] Acid Slimes used effectively
- [x] Kael commands goblins competently
- [x] Asterion defeats the Captain
- [x] Introduction of the "Mana Spike" hacking threat
