## Continuity Notes (From Chapter 48)
- Victor proposed a "vertical monopoly" of Eastmarch adventurer economy
- Gareth was shown a parchment with "10,000 GP annual revenue stream" projection
- ARMI: "Hostile Acquisition: Phase 1 Complete. Whale Harpooned."
- Gareth is sitting at the negotiation table in the Core Chamber

## Characters
- **Victor**: The CEO. Closing the deal.
- **Sir Gareth of House Sterling**: Humiliated but intrigued. Must decide whether to be a pawn or an envoy.
- **Nova**: The Core. Observing, calculating, providing infrastructure intel.
- **Valerius**: The Consultant. Monitoring external activity.
- **Sniv**: Customer Service / Reconnaissance. Reports unusual activity outside.

## Plot Beats

### 1. The Hook (200-300 words)
- Gareth stares at the parchment. The numbers don't lie.
- He knows his uncle. Lord Sterling will see the opportunity.
- But Gareth wants something for himself: revenge or profit.
- Victor reads his hesitation. Offers a "finder's fee" — personal commission for Gareth if the deal closes.

### 2. The Deal Terms (300-400 words)
- Victor outlines the proposal formally:
  - Sterling provides: Legitimacy, permits, trade route access, political cover
  - Victor provides: Dungeon revenue stream, exclusive adventurer training, potion supply chain
  - Revenue split: 35% Sterling, 65% Victor (but Sterling's 35% is of a MUCH larger pie)
- Gareth requests changes (trying to regain some dignity)
- Victor makes minor concession to let Gareth "win" something
- ARMI: **[Contract Drafted: Sterling Vertical Integration Agreement]**

### 3. The Handshake (250-350 words)
- Gareth agrees to carry the proposal to his uncle
- Victor offers tea. Gareth refuses. (Pride won't let him accept hospitality)
- Nova pulses — Victor notices something in the dungeon's sensory network
- Victor dismisses Gareth with a polite but firm "Your escort will see you out."
- Asterion appears to escort Gareth's party to the surface

### 4. The Warning (250-350 words)
- Once Gareth is gone, Nova speaks directly to Victor
- "ADMINISTRATOR. EXTERNAL ANOMALY DETECTED."
- Sniv bursts in with reconnaissance report: "Boss! Strangers in forest! Not adventurers! They watch. They write in books. They count things!"
- Valerius from topside confirms: "Guild scouts. At least three. They've been here since dawn."
- ARMI: **[Threat Assessment: Adventurer Guild — Reconnaissance in Progress]**

### 5. The Cliffhanger (200-300 words)
- Victor processes the new threat. The Alchemist Cartel is wounded but not dead. They've escalated.
- "They're not here to attack. They're here to document. Build a case."
- Nova: "A LEGAL HOSTILE TAKEOVER?"
- Victor: "Something like that. They're going to try to shut us down — lawfully."
- He looks at the dungeon entrance, at the forest beyond where unseen eyes watch.
- "Sniv. Get me everything we have on the Adventurer Guild's regulatory authority. Valerius, I need the permit codes Sterling gave us. Every loophole, every clause."
- Victor smiles. It's not a happy smile. It's the smile of a man who just realized the game has changed.
- "If they want to audit us... let's give them something to audit."
- ARMI: **[New Protocol: Regulatory Warfare — INITIATED]**

## Key Dialogues
- Gareth: "And what guarantees do I have that you won't cut us out once you're established?"
- Victor: "The same guarantee you have now: mutual profit. I gain nothing from betraying a partner. I gain everything from growing one."
- Nova: "EXTERNAL OBSERVERS DETECTED. HOSTILE INTENT: UNCLEAR."
- Sniv: "They have *clipboards*, Boss. Like Sniv! But their clipboards... are for *bad things*."
- Victor: "The Guild thinks they can shut us down with paperwork. They have no idea who they're dealing with."

## ARMI Updates
- **[Contract Drafted]**: Sterling Vertical Integration Agreement (Pending Lord Sterling Approval)
- **[Threat Assessment]**: Adventurer Guild — Reconnaissance in Progress
- **[New Protocol]**: Regulatory Warfare — INITIATED

## Themes
- Deals close, but new threats open
- The transition from physical warfare to bureaucratic warfare
- Victor's true domain: turning rules into weapons

## Style Notes
- Mobile-optimized paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Nova's speech should be ALL CAPS (established pattern)
- The mood shifts from "victory" to "new threat" in the final act
- End with determination, not fear
