# Outline: Chapter 70 - The Stress Test

**Word Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words

---

## Hook (200-300 words)

Next morning. The **Crimson Blades** arrive at the dungeon entrance.

Leader: **Theron Bloodstrike** (the same warrior who vandalized the dungeon in Ch 57).

He's here because Victor called in the "favor"—the Guild forced the Crimson Blades to stress-test Floor 5 for free as penance for their previous vandalism.

Theron is NOT happy.

"You want us to fight a *dragon*?" Theron asks.

Victor: "I want you to *survive* a dragon. There's a difference."

The party (5 members):
- Theron (tank/leader)
- Mira (healer)
- Kael (rogue)
- Elena (mage)
- Garrick (archer)

All level 17-19. Experienced. Cocky.

**Opening tension**: This is Victor's first real test of Floor 5. If the Crimson Blades die, Victor has a PR disaster. If they win too easily, the floor isn't challenging enough.

## Development

### Beat 1: The Descent (400 words)

The Crimson Blades enter Floor 5.

Immediate reactions:
- "It's like walking into an oven."
- Elena casts cooling enchantments (expires after 20 minutes)
- Mira distributes fire resistance potions (limited supply)

They navigate:
- Obsidian bridges (Kael nearly slips, catches himself)
- Lava rivers (Garrick tests with arrow—melts instantly)
- Sulfur vents (poisonous gas, forces detour)
- Fire crystals (Elena wants to harvest—Victor via magical projection: "After the fight")

Environmental damage testing:
- Heat damage: 5 HP/minute without protection
- Lava = instant death
- Sulfur = 10 HP/tick poison damage

Victor watches via scrying orb from his office. Taking notes.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Stress Test Metrics**:
> - Time to reach boss: 18 minutes (TARGET: 15-20 minutes)
> - Resource depletion: 40% potions used (ACCEPTABLE)
> - Environmental hazard effectiveness: HIGH
> - Party cohesion: STABLE

Theron: "This is insane. We haven't even reached the boss yet."

Victor (via projection): "That's the point. End-game content filters casuals."

### Beat 2: The Dragon Fight (600 words)

They reach Ignatia's arena.

She's arranged herself dramatically on a lava throne, fake gems glittering. Wings spread. Eyes glowing.

"BOW," the  pressure plate demands (magical voice).

Theron refuses. Door stays shut.

"BOW," it repeats.

Theron, furious, bows. The others follow.

Door opens.

Ignatia: "Welcome, mortals, to your -trial by fire. I am Ignatia, the Ember Tyrant. You may *attempt* to claim my hoard. But know this: Few have faced me and lived."

(She's clearly enjoying this.)

**Fight begins:**

**Phase 1: Testing** (3 minutes)
- Iggy uses basic fire breath, claw swipes
- Theron tanks, barely holds aggro
- Mira healing on cooldown
- Kael tries backstab—scales too thick
- Elena lands fireball (does minimal damage—fire resistance)
- Garrick shoots eyes (Iggy roars, angry now)

**Phase 2: Escalation** (4 minutes)
- Iggy takes flight, rains fire from above
- Party scatters
- Garrick hit by wing buffet (40 HP damage, knocked prone)
- Elena switches to ice magic (effective!)
- Kael finds weak spot: under-wing membrane
- Theron: "Focus fire on the wings!"

**Phase 3: Climax** (3 minutes)
- Party coordinates
- Elena freezes left wing
- Kael slashes membrane
- Iggy crashes to ground, furious
- Unleashes "Inferno Burst" (ultimate ability)
- Mira shields party (barely survives)
- Final push: Everyone burns cooldowns
- Theron lands killing blow (non-lethal—magical contract)

Iggy "dies" (dramatic collapse), then respawns at 30% HP per contract.

She nods. "Well fought."

Loot chest appears: Fire ruby, enchanted gauntlets, 200 GP.

### Beat 3: The Debrief (400 words)

Back in Victor's office.

Crimson Blades are exhausted, burned, but impressed.

Theron: "That was... actually incredible."

Victor: "Feedback?"

**Theron's Analysis**:
- Environmental hazards: 10/10 (brutal but fair)
- Boss difficulty: 9/10 (perfectly tuned for level 17+)
- Loot quality: 8/10 (good, could be slightly better)
- Spectacle: 10/10 ("Best dragon fight I've ever seen")

**Concerns**:
- Potion cost (600 GP in consumables used)
- Time investment (45 minutes total—is revenue worth it?)

Victor runs numbers:

> **[ARMI]**
> **Floor 5 Economics**:
> - Entry fee: 100 GP/party (premium pricing)
> - Average loot value: 300 GP
> - Consumables required: ~600 GP
> - **Net cost to adventurers**: 400 GP
> - **Victor's profit**: 100 GP entry + 8% transport fee (Merchant's Guild) = 124 GP per run
> - **Break-even**: 65 runs to recover 8,000 GP investment
> - **Timeline**: 3 months at 5 runs/week

Theron: "Will people pay 100 GP entry?"

Victor: "For a dragon fight? Yes. You're proof."

Theron pauses. Then nods. "We'll be back. With friends."

## Cliffhanger (200 words)

That evening, Victor updates his projections.

Floor 5 is viable. Difficult, but fair. Spectacle-driven.

But he needs **volume**.

100 GP entry fee x 5 parties/week = 500 GP/week = 2,000 GP/month.

That's... barely profitable after costs.

Victor runs a new calculation:

**What if... Floor 5 becomes a *tournament*?**

Weekly competitive runs. Leaderboards. Prizes.

"Best time to defeat Ignatia: 100 GP prize"

That creates:
1. Repeat business (guilds competing for rankings)
2. Spectator events (charge admission)
3. Sponsorship opportunities (merchants advertise to adventurers)

He pulls up a draft announcement:

> **DUNGEON INSOLVIA PRESENTS:**
> **THE EMBER TRIALS**
> **Weekly Dragon Gauntlet**
> **100 GP Entry | 500 GP Grand Prize**
> **Fame. Glory. Loot.**

Valerius reads it. "Boss... are you turning the dungeon into a *sport*?"

Victor: "No. I'm turning it into a *brand*."

Down in Floor 5, Ignatia practices her monologue.

She's already workshopping improvements.
