## Summary

Chapter 4 successfully establishes the dungeon's economy through slime farming. Victor's role as coordinator (not combatant) is perfectly maintained. The rat bribery scene is both humorous and thematically consistent with his corporate approach. Food security achieved.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to Sync - no revisions needed.
