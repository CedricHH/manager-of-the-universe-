## Detailed Feedback

### Strengths
1. **The "Performance Review" Skill**: Using a skill to read the boss's psychological state instead of combat stats is a brilliant subversion of the genre.
2. **Asterion's Characterization**: Transforming a generic dungeon boss into a bored, depressed employee fits the satire perfectly.
3. **Dialogue**: "I want you to be a King" vs "I want you to be a General" - great escalation of the pitch.

### Suggestions
- The chapter flows very well. No major changes needed. The ending sets up the "Aggressive Negotiations" arc perfectly.

## Summary
A standout chapter that perfectly encapsulates the "Corporate Satire" genre. Victor defeats a boss without throwing a punch, using only empathy (weaponized as management) and ambition.
