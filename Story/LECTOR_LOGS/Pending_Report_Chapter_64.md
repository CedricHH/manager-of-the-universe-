# Lector Report: Chapter 64

## 1. Overview
- **Chapter**: 64 - The Capital Injection
- **Word Count**: 1518 [PASS]
- **Status**: [APPROVED]

## 2. Qualitative Analysis
- **Creativity**: "The Jungle of Avarice" and "Loot Futures" continue the strong financial theme.
- **Tone**: The shift to "Fast Travel" as a bureaucratic loophole ("Equal Access to Danger") is hilarious and fits Victor perfectly.
- **Cliffhanger**: The "Financial Parasite" (Gold Mosquitoes) is a great literal manifestation of debt.

## 3. Issues & Fixes
| ID | Severity | Issue | Proposed Fix | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 01 | **Critical** | Word Count is too low (1077 vs 1500). | **EXPAND**:  1. Add a scene of *negotiating* with Gorg (The Ape King) to show the "hiring process."  2. Expand the "Stress Test" scene - show the Whales failing a few times or arguing about tactics. | [REQUIRED] |
| 02 | Minor | Roland's compliance check feels too brief. | Add a moment where Roland actually inspects the slide mechanism for "Safety". | [APPROVED] |

## 4. Implementation Plan
- **Beat 1 Expansion**: Scene where Victor negotiates Gorg's contract (Benefits, banana breaks, performance bonuses).
- **Beat 2 Expansion**: Roland inspecting the "Gravity Shoot" with a tape measure.
- **Beat 3 Expansion**: The Whales preparing for the fight (buffing up, arguing about loot distribution).

## 5. Sync Triggers
- **New Floor**: Floor 4 (Jungle of Avarice).
- **New Boss**: Gorg (The Ape King).
- **New Threat**: Gold Mosquitoes (Mana/Interest Siphon).
- **New Mechanic**: Gravity Shoots (Fast Travel).
