## Overview
A fantastic "office-style" chapter that turns a dungeon audit into a battle of wits and economics. The introduction of zoning laws as a weapon is a masterstroke and perfectly aligns with Victor's background. The "12% counter-offer" is a classic Victor move.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 85 | Character: "Grok" | New minor character? Check for consistency. | PENDING CHECK |
| 142 | Concept: Zoning Laws | "Class C Wilderness" vs "Class B Commercial". Good worldbuilding consistency. | OK |
| 235 | Economics: "Twenty gold a month" | Establishing baseline salaries for Guild officials. Good for world economy. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The contrast between the "mahogany desk" in the forest and the "dark maw" of the cave is visually striking.
- Asterion's growth (mentioning his "portfolio") is a great humorous beat that shows Victor's influence on the dungeon environment.
