# Walkthrough: Pipe Lector Chapters 21-25

We have completed the comprehensive quality control and data synchronization for Chapters 21 through 25 of *The Manager of the Universe*. This batch of chapters focused on the encounter with the **Silver Lance** adventuring party and the formalization of the dungeon's management structure.

## 🛠 Fixes & Improvements

````carousel
### Chapter 21: Aggressive Negotiations
- **Character Consistency**: Removed the phantom character "Mira (Archer)" and replaced her with **Lysa (Cleric)** to maintain alignment with the party list.
- **Level Balancing**: Standardized levels for **Gareth (12)**, **Bron (14)**, and **Kaelie (13)** based on their established character profiles.
- **Tone & Style**: Standardized Victor's attire to a "tailored Italian suit" throughout.

### Chapter 22 & 23: The Performance & The Invoice
- **Boss Scaling**: Corrected a recurring discrepancy where **Asterion** was referred to as Level 25. He has been reset to his canonical **Level 20** to maintain internal logic.
- **Word Count**: Adjusted the final monologue in Chapter 25 to meet the minimum **1500-word target**.

### Project Infrastructure
- **Departmentalization**: Formally registered **Sniv** as HR Director and **Zip** as Head of R&D in the character wikis.
- **Dungeon Core**: Updated the [Dungeon Core](file:///Characters/Dungeon_Core.md) profile to reflect its discovery in Chapter 24 and official activation in Chapter 25.
