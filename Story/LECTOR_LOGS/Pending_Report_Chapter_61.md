# Lector Report: Chapter 61

## 1. Overview
- **Chapter**: 61 - The Divine Audit
- **Word Count**: ~1,500 (Estimated)
- **Status**: [PENDING]

## 2. Qualitative Analysis
- **Hook**: "The door simply ceased to exist." High-impact opening that immediately establishes the power gap.
- **Pacing**: Intense. The standoff relies on dialogue and tension rather than combat, which fits the "Manager" theme.
- **Character Voice**:
    - **Aldric**: "A bit dramatic, Aurelia." perfect dismissal. Shows his arrogance.
    - **Victor**: "I assume you have prepared the compensation package?" - Peak Victor. Trying to invoice a natural disaster.
    - **Aurelia**: "I am cleansing Heresy!" - Good contrast to the cynical men.
- **Plot Logic**: Aldric intervening for money is the perfect resolution to the arc. It saves the dungeon but compromises Victor morally/politically (he is now funding a corrupt regime).

## 3. Issues & Fixes
| ID | Severity | Issue | Proposed Fix | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 01 | Minor | Would the Royal Guard aim swords at a High Priestess? | Yes, if ordered by the Crown Prince. It heightens the tension (Civil War implication). | [IGNORE] |
| 02 | Minor | Nova's reaction is a bit passive. | Nova spins and glows red (Panic). This is sufficient for a non-verbal entity. | [IGNORE] |

## 4. Implementation Plan
- No major changes needed. The chapter flows well and hits all beat requirements.

## 5. Sync Triggers
- **Status Change**: Dungeon is now "Chartered" (Legal).
- **New Condition**: [Mark of the Watcher] - Church Paladin stationed outside.
- **Relationship Update**: Aldric is now a paid protector. Aurelia is an open enemy.
- **Nova**: Existence confirmed to Church.
