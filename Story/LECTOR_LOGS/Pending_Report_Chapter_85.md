# 🧐 LECTOR ANALYSIS: Chapter 85 - The Decompression Protocol

## 📊 QUICK SCORE
- **Hook Strength**: 9/10
- **Pacing**: 10/10
- **Victor's Voice**: 10/10
- **Cliffhanger**: 9/10
- **Overall**: PASS (With minor addition)

## 🛑 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

1. **Word Count**: 1,498 words. It is literally 2 words short of the 1,500 minimum. 
   - *Location*: End of the chapter.
   - *Fix*: Expand the final interaction with Hestia slightly to push it comfortably over 1,500.

## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES

- **Mana-Sickness**: The "Gold Toxicity" warning (12%) is a nice touch. Maybe emphasize physical symptoms briefly?
   - *Location*: Line ~90 (after liquidation).
   - *Fix*: Add a sentence about Victor feeling the "heaviness" or "metallic taste" of the gold in his blood.

## ✅ WHAT WORKED

- **The Scene Switch**: Cutting to Mina/Silas was excellent for tension.
- **The Concept**: "Liquidating an explosion" is peak Victor Kaine.
- **Hestia**: She is evolving from "enemy" to "intriguing rival/mentor" perfectly.

## 📜 CHANGE LOG

| Line | Original | New | Action | Status |
|------|----------|-----|--------|--------|
| 34 (Mina/Silas) | [Added scene] | [Scene integrated well] | KEEP | APPROVED |
| 90 | [Gold Toxicity warning] | [Add physical reaction] | INSERT | PENDING |
| 130 (Hestia) | "The Bureau has... other interests" | [Expand slightly] | EXPAND | PENDING |

**VERDICT**: An excellent climax to the "social" arc. Just needs a tiny push to cross the word count finish line.
