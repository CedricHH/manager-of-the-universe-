## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 |

| Cliffhanger | 9/10 |
| Word Count | 10/10 (1788 words) |

## Overview
A masterclass in bridging the "surface" and "dungeon" plots. The recruitment of Kael and Mira using equity and dental plans is both hilarious and perfectly in character. The escalation into "Protocol: Fortress" provides a clear end-point for the tourism phase and sets up a high-stakes siege.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 18 | Grammar: "An illusion shimmering faded" | Change to "The shimmering illusion faded". | PENDING FIX |
| 119 | Typo: "Converion" | Change to "Conversion". | PENDING FIX |
| 157 | Logic: Article 4 (Mutual Defense). | Excellent callback to the partnership with Sterling. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The "Acidic potion slimes" diet is a fantastic use of established worldbuilding (slimes as waste disposal).
- Victor's explanation of history being written by winners with better "budget management" is a peak corporate-evil line.
