## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| - | Word Count Deficit | The chapter needs expansion (approx. 500 words). Suggest expanding the boss fight "evaluation" or adding more detail to the treasure room scene. | PENDING |

## Observations
- **Asterion's Voice**: "Performance evaluation" instead of "Death match" is very on-brand for Victor's leadership style.
- **Treasure Room**: The organized, labeled sections are a great visual representation of the new dungeon management.
- **Victor's Character**: The revelation that he gave away the leverage on Earth for free ("Anonymous. Untraceable.") provides him with a moral backbone that balances his cynicism.
- **The Core/Nova**: The naming scene is a strong emotional payoff for the business negotiation.

## Proposed Fix (Expansion)
- Expand the actual combat—describe a few moves where Asterion specifically "tests" the members (e.g., testing Bron's weight distribution or Mira's casting speed under pressure).
- Add more detail to the loot distribution—have the adventurers react to the "Quality-Tested" labels and the concept of "Verified Enchantments."
- Deepen the final scene where the partnership becomes official—show the physical changes in the Core Chamber as the systems wake up.
