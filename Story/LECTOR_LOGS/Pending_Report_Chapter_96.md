## Strengths

1. **Opening Hook**: Debt visualization (-15,000 GP) creates immediate tension
2. **Information Asymmetry**: Victor appears wealthy while actually broke = clever leverage
3. **Aurelia Characterization**: Cold, calculating, matches established character from Ch 61
4. **Negotiation Dialogue**: Feels authentic; corporate jargon applied to religious institution
5. **Paradox Ending**: Solution (Church contract) creates problem (G.A.C. violation) = perfect escalation
6. **Victor's Contingencies**: "Six wills depending on how I die" = darkly funny, very in-character

## Minor Issues

| Issue | Fix | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Line 65: "feed for Iggy" - cute but breaks tone slightly | Consider "Floor 5 maintenance" (more generic, less pet-like) | APPROVED |
| Aurelia's physical intimidation (standing/towering) could use MORE physical description | Add: "She rose to full height—nearly six feet in golden vestments, divine mana crackling" | APPROVED |
| The six wills joke feels SLIGHTLY too comedic for the stakes | Keep but add Victor's deadpan delivery: "Kade stared. Victor didn't smile." | APPROVED |

## Structural Notes

### Three-Act Chapter Structure:

1. **Setup** (Debt problem + preparation): ✓ Clear stakes
2. **Confrontation** (Cathedral negotiation): ✓ Excellent dialogue
3. **Twist** (G.A.C. violation notice): ✓ Perfect escalation

### Dialogue Quality:

- Aurelia: Authoritative but desperate (well-balanced)
- Victor: Clinical, transactional (perfect voice)
- Sniv: Comic relief without undermining tension

### World-Building Expansion:

- Church politics revealed (delegation = admission of weakness)
- Market dynamics (demand surge creates price increase)
- G.A.C. policy introduced (dependency relationship clause)

## Approved Changes

### Change 1: Tone Adjustment (Line 65)

**Current:**
> Daily Operating Costs: 450 GP (dungeon maintenance, salaries, feed for Iggy)

**Revised:**
> Daily Operating Costs: 450 GP (dungeon maintenance, employee salaries, Floor 5 operations)

**Reason:** "Feed for Iggy" anthropomorphizes the dragon boss; maintains professional tone

---

### Change 2: Physical Description Enhancement (Line 180-185)

**Add after "Aurelia stood—towering over the table.":**

> She rose to full height—nearly six feet in golden vestments that gleamed with embedded divine crystals. Divine mana crackled visibly around her hands.

**Reason:** Adds visceral intimidation; shows Victor isn't intimidated by physical power

---

### Change 3: Comedic Beat Grounding (Line 95)

**Current:**
> "You have a will?"
> "I have **six**," Victor said. "Depends on how I die."

**Revised:**
> "You have a will?"
> "I have **six**," Victor said. "Depends on how I die."
> Kade stared. Victor didn't smile.

**Reason:** Grounds the dark humor; shows Victor is serious, not joking

---

## Summary

Strong chapter that successfully:
- Establishes Church partnership (major plot development)
- Reveals Victor's financial vulnerability (humanizes character)
- Creates new crisis via G.A.C. policy (escalates stakes)
- Maintains Victor's voice (treats religion as business)

The negotiation scene is a series highlight—Victor calling the Church a "brand" and "storefront" to the High Priestess's face captures his character perfectly.

Approved with three minor polish edits.
