# Lector Analysis: Chapter 47 - The Revenue Stream

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 |

| Cliffhanger | 9/10 |
| Word Count | 10/10 (1979 words) |

## Overview
A masterclass in transforming classic fantasy tropes (dungeon crawl) into corporate satire. The "Velvet Rope" protocol and Sniv as a greeter with a tie are highlights. The contrast between the "Iron Boots" (standard adventurers) and Sir Gareth (the whale) provides excellent class-based conflict.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 28 | Typo: "Velver Rope" | Change to "Velvet Rope". | PENDING FIX |
| 172 | Logic: "Arrogance Surcharge" | Excellent and in-character move. | OK |
| 227 | System: "Whale Detected" | Perfect use of the ARMI UI for corporate jargon overlap. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The "Insolvia Vitality Draughts" (healing potions) is a great secondary revenue stream (ancillary revenue).
- Sniv's tie should be mentioned in his character file under "Uniform".
- Gareth of House Sterling should be added to the relationship table in Victor's file.
