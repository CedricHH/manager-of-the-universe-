# Walkthrough: Pipe Lector Chapter 31

We have completed the quality control and data synchronization for Chapter 31: "Dungeon 2.0".

## 🛠 Key Developments

- **Infrastructure Upgrades**: Victor reinvested 70 GP into **Trap Automation** (reducing labor overhead) and a **Floor 3 Mining Expansion** (diversifying revenue streams).
- **HR Policy**: Implemented the **"Scheduled Maintenance"** policy, giving goblins one rest day per week to optimize long-term productivity and prevent burnout.
- **The Mystery**: Discovery of a **"Pre-Dungeon" seal** on Floor 3, dating back over 800 years, which predates Nova's own creation.

## 📂 Project Sync Status

| File | Updates Made |
|------|--------------|
| [Victor_Kaine.md](file:///Characters/Victor_Kaine.md) | Added history for Ch 31 (Upgrades, HR Policy, Seal discovery). |
| [Sniv.md](file:///Characters/Sniv.md) | Updated with his role as Project Manager and HR lead for the new rest schedule. |
| [Zip.md](file:///Characters/Zip.md) | Recorded his structural designs for the mine and his discovery of the ancient seal. |
| [Dungeon_Core.md](file:///Characters/Dungeon_Core.md) | Updated Nova's history with the financial investment and the detection of the pre-dungeon structure. |

## 📊 Verification Results
- **Word Count**: 1837 words (Target: 1500-2000).
- **Consistency**: Math for GP balance and project timelines is correct.
- **Narrative**: The transition from purely defensive management to infrastructure expansion is well-handled.
