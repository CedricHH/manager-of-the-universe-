### Pacing (9/10)
- Dialogue-heavy structure keeps momentum
- Scene transitions clean (inn → Core Chamber)
- ARMI messages break up text appropriately
- Mobile-optimized paragraph length
- No slowdowns or info-dumps

### Voice (10/10)
- Perfect Victor characterization: "Calculated risk. Higher than any operation he'd faced in Arc 1."
- Kira's voice distinct: Direct, no-nonsense, professional
- No emotional bleeding - pure calculation
- Corporate lens maintained: "Standard corporate hierarchy—failure pruning at each level"

### Cliffhanger (9/10)
**Last 200 words analysis:**
- BROKEN CROWN mission reveal
- Dual pressure setup (Guild War + Consortium decision)

### Competence Display (10/10)

- Never outmatched, even when surprised

## Recommendations

### None Required
Chapter meets all quality standards. No revisions needed.

### Optional Enhancements (Not Critical)

---
