## Consistencies & Logic
- **Math**: 14 goblins organized into 3 departments (4+4+4=12) + 1 Sniv + 1 Victor = 14. ❌ ERROR.
  - Fix needed: Victor does not count as a goblin employee. Sniv + 12 workers = 13 goblins. 14 - 1 (Sniv in management) = 13, but we have 12 in teams + 3 leads = 15. Need clarification.
  - ACTUALLY: 4+4+4 = 12 workers. 3 leads. 1 Sniv. Victor is boss. Total: 12 + 3 + 1 (Sniv) = 16? No.
  - RE-CHECK: 4 Food + 4 Guard + 4 Labor = 12. Each team has 1 Lead. Leads are part of the 4. So 4 (including lead) per team. 4+4+4 = 12. Sniv = 1. Victor = 1. Total = 14. But Victor is human. So 13 goblins + Victor? No - ARMI says 14 goblins.
  - **RESOLUTION**: ARMI states "Workers: 10 (Reporting to Leads)". If 3 Leads + 10 Workers + 1 Sniv = 14 goblins. Perfect. No error.
- **Character**: Sniv's "Sniv is on the wall" moment is excellent character development.
- **Plot**: 28 hostile goblins vs 14. Half can fight = 14 vs 14. Logic sound.
