## ✅ WHAT WORKED
- **Cold Open**: Starting with blood/violence immediately establishes stakes.
- **The Org Chart**: This is peak "Corporate Manager in Fantasy." Victor drawing an organizational structure on the wall for goblins is chef's kiss.
- **Sniv's Pride**: "Sniv is on the wall" is a surprisingly touching character moment.
- **Discipline System**: Withholding food as consequence + "collective liability" for all involved is perfect corporate logic applied ruthlessly.

**VERDICT**: Excellent escalation. Victor is building systems, not just surviving. The cliffhanger ("we take Floor Three") sets up the next arc perfectly.
