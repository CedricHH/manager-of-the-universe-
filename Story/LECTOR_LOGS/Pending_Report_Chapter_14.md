## Issues
| Line | Type | Problem | Suggested Fix | Status |
|------|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| 161 | Typo | "...corks form a bottle." | Change to "...corks **from** a bottle." | PENDING |
| 216 | Continuity | "Level 25 Minotaur." | Asterion is Level 20 (established in Ch 10 & 11). Change to "Level 20". | PENDING |
| 17 | Logic | "Guard-1, Labor-15, and two recruits..." | Context implies these are the "department heads" from Ch 11, but Mining-Lead isn't here? No, Victor just chose a specific team. | OK |
| 137 | Grammar | "Her eyes darting to every shadow..." | Change to "Her eyes darted to every shadow..." | PENDING |
