## Overview
A pivot point where the conflict shifts from economic and physical to regulatory. The "finder's fee" bribe to Gareth is a classic Victor move, and the introduction of the Adventurer Guild scouts raises the stakes appropriately.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 17 | Consistency: "Lord Reginald" | Change to "Lord Aldric". | PENDING FIX |
| 139 | Voice: "Groll knows that." | Perfect alignment with Groll's character as a smart antagonist. | OK |
| 164 | Protocol: "Regulatory Warfare" | Strong ARMI UI element consistent with Victor's background. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- Update Victor's skills: Add [Regulatory Warfare] (or [Institutional Navigation] already covers this, but the specific mention of audit compliance is good).
- Update Sir Gareth's relationship: "Bribed Collaborator".
- Update Groll's status: Engaging in regulatory reconnaissance.
