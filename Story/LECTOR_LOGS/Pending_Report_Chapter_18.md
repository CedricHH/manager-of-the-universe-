## Recommendations

1. **REQUIRED**: Add 1 ARMI message. Suggested location: After Victor wakes from nightmare (line 134), add biometrics/stress check
2. **Minor**: The flashback timeline jumps (Day 30, 60, 90, 150) are effective - keep

## Suggested Fix

After line 134 ("Victor gasped, sitting bolt upright..."), add:

```markdown
> **[ARMI]**
> **Biometrics Alert**: Heart Rate 142 BPM | Cortisol: Critical
> **Sleep Quality**: Interrupted (REM Disruption)
> **Status**: Psychological Distress Detected
```
