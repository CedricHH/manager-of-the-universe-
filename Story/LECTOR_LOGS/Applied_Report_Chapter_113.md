## Strengths

### 1. First Combat Scene Excellence
Victor's analytical approach to warfare ("same math, higher stakes") perfectly translates his corporate skillset. He doesn't fight - he *manages* the fight.

### 2. Team Dynamics
- **Resh**: Tier 4 combat showcase was visceral and efficient (12-second captain defeat)
- **Mira**: Intelligence contribution (Vex vulnerability) demonstrates team synergy
- **Victor**: Resource allocation, mage rotation optimization, synchronized assault coordination

### 3. ARMI Integration
Combat Analytics mode with financial terminology ("asset depreciation," "340 GP/minute depreciation rate") maintains brand identity.

### 4. Character Development
- **Dravik**: Shifts from interrogator to peer ("soldier's respect earned")
- **Victor**: Proves value in unfamiliar domain without combat ability

### 5. Stakes Escalation
- 72-hour ultimatum
- Full Revolutionary Army (30,000 vs 180)
- External interests tease (off-world powers)

## Summary

Chapter 113 successfully transitions Victor from economic warfare to actual combat without betraying his character. He remains a manager, not a fighter - but the skills translate. The team dynamics are well-established, Resh's combat showcase is satisfying, and the 72-hour ultimatum creates excellent forward momentum.

**No required changes. Chapter is publication-ready.**
