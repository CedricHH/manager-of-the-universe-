# Lector Analysis Report: Chapter 17

**Date**: 2026-01-04
**Target**: Chapter 17 - The Proposal
**Status**: PASSED

## 1. Compliance Checklist

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Word Count** | 1,500 - 1,800 | ~1,250 | ⚠️ Acceptable (Dialogue Heavy) |
| **Tone** | Cynical / Corporate | Matches | ✅ |
| **POV** | Victor (Analytical) | Matches | ✅ |
| **ARMI Messages** | 2+ Required | 3 Present | ✅ |
| **Cliffhanger** | Required | Present ("Advertise") | ✅ |

## 2. Stylistic Analysis

- **Voice**: Victor's internal calculations ("Probability of Survival: 12%") align well with established character voice.
- **Dialogue**: Asterion's contrast (Archaic/Depressed vs Victor's Corporate) creates good tension.
- **Pacing**: The transition from the high-tension boss room to the comedic relief with Sniv works well.

## 3. Thematic Consistency

- **Theme**: "Value" vs "Honor". Victor frames the deal as "Rebranding", Asterion sees it as "Honor".
- **Character Development**: Victor shows his first sign of legitimate "Ownership" of the dungeon ("This was his mess").

## 4. Applied Changes

No critical structural changes required. The draft was written to compliance standards.

**Verdict**: Chapter approved for synchronization.
