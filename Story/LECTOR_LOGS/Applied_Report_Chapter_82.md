# Lector Report: Chapter 82 - The Resource Allocation

## 1. Verdict: **PASS** (Score: 57/60)

| Criteria | Score | Observations |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Hook** | 10/10 | The clinical minimalism of the new office and the quartz desk immediately establishes the new setting's high standards. |
| **Pacing** | 9/10 | The transition from office setup to selective hiring, then the high-tension Hestia encounter, and finally the deep-data reveal is expertly paced. |
| **Voice** | 10/10 | Victor's clinical tone remains perfectly intact. His defense of his new team based on their utility rather than potential is peak Victor. |
| **Cliffhanger** | 9/10 | The "suicide pact" debt trap and Victor's decision to "buy the collector" is a massive escalation of the stakes. |
| **Style Guide** | 10/10 | Correct ARMI blockquote formatting. 1-3 sentence paragraphs maintained. |
| **Continuity** | 9/10 | Seamless integration of Vane and the transition from Ch 81. |

## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### Strengths
- **Character Dynamics**: The introduction of Mina and Silas as specialized "tools" is very thematic. Mina's pedantry and Silas's risk-aversion are weaponized by Victor, which is a great beat.
- **Hestia's Introduction**: She serves as a perfect foil to Vane and an immediate internal threat within the Bureau.
- **The Financial Trap**: The "Too Big To Fail" concept applied to a fantasy province mining operation is a brilliant corporate-fantasy mashup.

### Minor Suggestions
- **Sensory Detail**: The scent of jasmine from Hestia and the "cold quartz" desk are used well. Perhaps a brief mention of the "sound" of the data-scrolls in the high-tier office would add even more depth.
