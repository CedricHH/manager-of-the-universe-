## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 69 | "Level 25 boss" | Change to "Level 20 boss" to match previous chapters and Asterion's profile. | PENDING |
| 167 | "We'll... table that one for now." | This is a great line, but make sure "goblin launchers" aren't actually implemented until later! | NOTE |

## Observations
- The recruitment of Zip adds a needed specialist role to the organization.
- Transition from "Boss" to "Management" in Asterion's perception is well-handled.
- Consistent use of ARMI for organizational updates.
- Aldric the Unbowed (Guild Leader) vs Crown Prince Aldric: Potential name confusion, but acceptable as foreshadowing or separate entities.
