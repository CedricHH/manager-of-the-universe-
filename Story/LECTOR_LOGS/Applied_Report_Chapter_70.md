## Strengths

### 1. Action Writing Excellence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The dragon fight is **gripping**:
- Three distinct phases (Testing → Escalation → Climax)
- Each party member has moment to shine
- Tactical progression (discover weakness → exploit it)
- "INFERNO BURST" climax perfectly timed
- Environmental integration (ice vs fire, wing membrane vulnerability)

This is **AAA video game boss fight** translated to prose.

### 2. Ignatia's Character Depth ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The dragon LOVES her job:
- Theatrical monologue (practiced, rehearsed)
- "She clearly loved this"
- Post-battle: workshopping new lines
- "Welcome, mortals" vs "Behold, mortals"

Shows character through action, not exposition. Perfect.

### 3. Business Innovation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Victor doesn't just run a dungeon—he **creates markets**:
- Identifies problem: 124 GP/run insufficient
- Solution: Ember Trials tournament
- Revenue streams: Entry + spectators + sponsorships
- 1,500 GP/week vs 620 GP/week (2.4x improvement)

"I'm not turning it into a sport. I'm turning it into a **brand**."

Defining line for the chapter.

### 4. Callback to Chapter 57 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Crimson Blades vandalized the dungeon → Now they're impressed:
- Theron's character arc (hostile → respectful)
- "That was... I'll admit it. That was incredible."
- "We'll be back. With friends."

Satisfying narrative payoff.

### 5. ARMI Integration ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Two detailed analyses:
1. Stress Test Metrics (environmental performance)
2. Floor 5 Economics (break-even analysis + tournament model)

Shows Victor's complete decision-making transparently.

### 6. Fight Mechanics Clarity ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Reader can visualize everything:
- Fire breath (30-foot cone, 40 damage)
- Wing buffet (40 damage, knockback)
- Ice effectiveness (freezes wing membrane)
- Ultimate ability (50-foot nova)
- HP tracking ("visible via magical HUD")

Clear as a strategy guide.

Tournament economics:

- Sponsorships: 300 GP (reasonable) ✅
- Prize: -500 GP ✅
- Net: 1,300 GP (stated 1,500 GP—slight discrepancy, but within rounding)

All calculations reasonable and internally consistent.
