## ✅ WHAT WORKED
- **Competence Porn**: The entire negotiation sequence is gold. Turning 14 enemies into 14 employees using 4 potions is classic Victor.
- **Character Intro**: Sniv's introduction ("Sniv will work") is perfect. Establishing his motivation (malnutrition/runt status) makes his betrayal of the pack believable.
