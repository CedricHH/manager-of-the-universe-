# Lector Analysis: Chapter 02

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook | 10/10 | Direct continuation from Ch 1, maintains tension. |
| Pacing | 9/10 | Good dialogue flow, effective use of ARMI interface. |
| Voice | 10/10 | "Performance Review" on goblins is excellent corporate satire. |
| Cliffhanger | 8/10 | "Now he just needed to make them productive." Solid, but less urgent than Ch 1. |
| Word Count | 10/10 | 1,579 words (Target: 1,500-2,000). |
| **Overall** | **9.5/10** | **Strong follow-up.** |

## Consistencies & Logic
- **Character**: Victor using "Health Potions" as "Signing Bonuses" fits his worldview perfectly.
- **Plot**: Recruitment of Sniv (Employee #1) is handled with logical progression.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| Multiple | Formatting: German quotation marks (`„`) used throughout. | Replace `„` with `"` | FIXED |
| 145 | Math/Logic: ARMI states "Investment: 4 Health Potions", but Victor used 1 (thrown) + 4 (distributed) = 5. Summary (Line 227) correctly says 5. | Change Line 145 to "Investment: 5 Health Potions (250 GP equivalent)" | FIXED |
