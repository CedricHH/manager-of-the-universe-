# Lector Report: Chapter 80 - The Automation Protocol

## 1. Verdict: **PASS** (Score: 58/60)

| Criteria | Score | Observations |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Hook** | 10/10 | The clean desk vs. the humming administrative office provides a great thematic contrast for Victor's departure. |
| **Pacing** | 10/10 | The "Farewell Tour" through Sniv, Asterion, and Elara feels earned and gives each character a satisfying beat. |
| **Voice** | 10/10 | Victor's clinical tone remains perfectly intact: "The choice isn't personal, Elara. It’s mathematical." |
| **Cliffhanger** | 10/10 | The arrival of the Imperial Auditor and the 500k GP hint is a massive setup for Act 2. |
| **Style Guide** | 9/10 | Correct ARMI formatting. Jargon used effectively ("Succession Protocol", "Bottleneck"). |
| **Continuity** | 9/10 | Solid wrap-up of Oakhaven arcs. References to Rivercrest and the Hub are seamless. |

## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### Strengths
- **Sniv's Promotion**: The detail about the SOP manual and him being too small for the chair adds a touch of heart without breaking the corporate tone.
- **The Imperial Auditor**: Thaddeus Vane is a great mirror character for Victor. The "skeletal horses that move with mechanical precision" is a nice worldbuilding touch for the Imperial Capital.
- **The Thematic Loop**: Victor leaving not because he lost, but because he "optimized" the region to the point of diminishing returns, is peak Corporate Overlord.

### Minor Suggestions
- **Elara's internal reaction**: While the dialogue is good, a brief sensory detail about the "scent of moss" replacing the "scent of incense" at the Hub would reinforce the change Victor brought.
- **Vane's Briefcase**: Minor detail, but mentioning it looks more advanced (magically) than Victor's current one would suggest a tech/power jump in Act 2.
