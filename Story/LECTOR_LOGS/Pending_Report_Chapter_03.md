# Lector Analysis: Chapter 03

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 | "The crisis passed." Good tonal shift to introspection. |
| Pacing | 10/10 | Excellent balance of character building (memories) and plot advancement (Sniv's report). |
| Voice | 10/10 | ARMI stat descriptions ("Can lift briefcase. No more.") are great. |
| Cliffhanger | 10/10 | "Show me Floor Two... The slimes. Now." Sets up immediate action. |
| Word Count | 10/10 | ~1,720 words (Target: 1,500-2,000). |
| **Overall** | **9.8/10** | **Great bridging chapter.** |

## Consistencies & Logic
- **Character**: Victor organizing a "workspace" in a dungeon is a perfect character beat.
- **Plot**: The resource crisis (food/gold) drives the plot naturally toward the slimes.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| Multiple | Formatting: German quotation marks (`„`) used throughout. | Replace `„` with `"` | FIXED |
| 76 | Math: "given away four health potions" - Consistent with Ch 2 error, but inconsistent with Ch 2 summary (5 potions). Victor used 5 total. | Change "four" to "five" and "two hundred GP" to "two hundred fifty GP" | FIXED |
