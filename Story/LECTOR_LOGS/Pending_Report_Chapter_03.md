## ✅ WHAT WORKED
- **Character Depth**: The first "Quiet Moment" works well to establish Victor's internal vulnerability (trembling hands) vs his external facade.
- **System Progression**: The ARMI status screen does a great job showing just how weak he is (0 GP, 4 STR) while hinting at future power ([Hostile Takeover]).
- **Sniv**: His report is charming and useful. "Big Scary (one—NO GO)" is great voice.
