## Observations
- **Voice**: Victor's internal monologue about "inefficient labor allocation" and "capital rich, cash poor" perfectly establishes the tension between corporate and noble logic.
- **Negotiation Mechanics**: The move from 15% to 23% (settling at 20% with a performance clause) is realistic and fits Victor's past experience with restructuring.
- **Critical Moment**: The reveal of the "managed dungeon" as a solution to Sterling's "organized monster" problem is a great turning point. Victor expertly turns a threat into an opportunity.
- **Dead-Man Switch**: A classic Victor move—contingency as a form of security.

## Final Verdict
Chapter is excellent and requires no fixes. Proceed to sync.
