## Issues

## Observations
- **Sniv's Professionalism**: Having Sniv act as the door-man with a clipboard is peak comedy.
- **Corporate Satire**: "Death insurance," "Participation certificate," and "Premium encounter" are excellent use of the genre.
- **Victor's Character**: The second half of the Earth flashback ("Passive blindness") is crucial for the series' emotional weight. It transforms Victor from a simple cynical manager to someone trying (perhaps subconsciously) to build a better system.
- **Math Check**: The 133% baseline check (35 GP vs 15 GP) is mathematically correct given the 5 GP/head and 15 GP premium fee.

## Proposed Fix (Expansion)
- Expand the initial confrontation—have the party argue more about the validity of the "Waiver."
- Add a scene showing Gareth's reluctance and Mira's analytical fascination during the Floor 1 traversal.
- Deepen the Earth flashback—describe the moment Victor tried to "leak" the documents and the cold reality of the "legal patch" that erased him.
