## Issues

| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 31 | "all five goblins jump" - The Board was changed to four members. | Change "five" to "four". | PENDING |
| 39 | "Then Guard-2!" - Consistent with Board changes, Sniv should probably refer to the Lead. | Change "Guard-2" to "Guard-Lead". | PENDING |
| 77 | "concept of a sad Minotaur clearly beyond his pay grade" - Slightly anachronistic metaphor (though common in this series, it's usually Victor's internal monologue, not narrator omniscient). | Keep as is, fits the "Corporate Satire" theme of the series. | OK |
| 205 | Narrative transition to end of chapter. | OK | OK |

## Word Count Check

- **Target**: 1,500 - 2,000 words
- **Status**: [OK]

## Continuity Check

- **Previous Chapter**: Flow from the imp's demand is seamless.
- **Character Levels**: Asterion (Lv 20) is correct for a first-floor-range boss. Victor's level is implicit but consistent with starting Phase 1.
- **Abilities**: [Performance Review] usage matches established mechanics.
