## Issues

| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 100, 132 | Scene breaks using only `**` - inconsistent with typical `---` or `***` | Replace `**` with `---` for clearer visual breaks | ✅ APPLIED |
| 80 | Nova's voice is in ALL CAPS - while distinctive, could be jarring for readers | Consider reducing frequency of ALL CAPS Nova dialogue or softening presentation | SKIPPED (style consistent with previous chapters) |
| 116 | Nova's telepathic message also ALL CAPS and quite long | Same as above | SKIPPED (style consistent with previous chapters) |
| 122 | "Zips can make messenger go away" - Zip refers to himself as "Zips" (plural) but character is singular | Standardize to "Zip" for consistency | ✅ APPLIED |
| N/A | Missing date/timeline reference | Consider adding internal timestamp for reader orientation | SKIPPED - not critical |

## Strengths

1. **Victor's Voice**: Excellent corporate lens throughout - "courting" vs "targeting," "optimization opportunities were beautiful"
2. **ARMI Messages**: Four well-placed system messages that add flavor without breaking narrative flow
3. **Supporting Cast**: Sniv ("boss-boss-boss"), Valerius (nervous energy), Zip (scout report) all contribute meaningfully
4. **Setup**: Strong foundation for Act 1.3 - Crown Prince Aldric arrival creates compelling stakes
5. **Sterling Callback**: Smart continuity showing Sterling's independent moves

---

## Summary

Solid transitional chapter that effectively bridges Act 1.2 to Act 1.3. Victor's strategic mindset remains sharp, the stakes are clearly established (72-hour window vs the Guild's slower petition process), and the supporting cast adds texture. Minor formatting issues don't impact readability.

**Recommendation**: Implement approved fixes (scene breaks, Zip name consistency). The ALL CAPS Nova dialogue is a style choice that should remain consistent with previous chapters.
