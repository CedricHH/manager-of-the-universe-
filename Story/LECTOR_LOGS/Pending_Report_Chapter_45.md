## Overview
A brilliant conclusion to the "hack" conflict. The use of "Bureaucratic Overload" as a magical attack is the peak of the character's concept. The introduction of the "Consultant" with silver spectacles hints at a deeper conspiracy within the Alchemist Guild, while the arrival of the Merchant Guild and Silver Lance at the end perfectly resets the tension for a political/PR conflict.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 35 | New Skill: [SKILL: HOSTILE TAKEOVER] | (Already synced in Ch 44 report, ensure it's in file). | OK |
| 91 | New Skill: [SKILL: BUREAUCRATIC OVERLOAD] | Add to Victor's character file. | PENDING SYNC |
| 220 | Voice: "attracted the HOA" | Excellent modern corporate comparison for the Merchant Guild/Silver Lance intervention. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The "IT Support 5 Stars" from Nova is a humorous beat that lightens the heavy mana-exhaustion scene.
- The distinction between Groll (the thug) and the Consultant (the specialist) suggests the Alchemist Cartel has external backing.
