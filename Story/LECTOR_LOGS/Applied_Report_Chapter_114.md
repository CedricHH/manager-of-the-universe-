2. **ARMI Integration**: System messages feel natural and add to corporate-warfare aesthetic
3. **Intangible Assets Reveal**: 847M GP revaluation is strong worldbuilding moment - elevates stakes beyond simple gold heist
4. **Coalition Math**: Victor's proposal (25% equity for Merchant Coalition, etc.) demonstrates competence through strategic thinking
5. **Character Dynamics**: Dravik's evolution from interrogator to peer feels earned after Ch 113 battle

## Summary

Chapter 114 executes its outline beats effectively. The Bank vault revelation (847M GP intangible assets) successfully reframes the conflict from "defend gold" to "preserve civilization's legal framework." Victor's coalition proposal demonstrates strategic competence. The compressed ultimatum (72h→48h) creates strong narrative urgency.

Word count is slightly elevated but justified by content quality and strategic exposition. No significant revisions needed.

**Recommended Action**: Accept as-is and proceed to sync phase.
