## Approved Changes

### Change 1: Expand Slime Farm Sensory Detail

**Location**: Lines 5-15 (opening description)

**Original**:
```
Victor picked up a health core from the processing bin. Translucent green, pulsing with condensed mana. Perfect quality.
```

**Replacement**:
```
Victor picked up a health core from the processing bin. Translucent green, pulsing with condensed mana. The core was warm to the touch—living energy contained in crystalline form. It hummed faintly, resonating with his ARMI interface. Perfect quality.
```

**Reason**: Adds tactile and auditory sensory detail (20 words)

**Status**: APPROVED

---

### Change 2: Vary "Twelve Years" Phrasing

**Location**: Lines 135-138 (Marcus's internal monologue)

**Original**:
```
Marcus moved through the process with mechanical precision.

Twelve years in the old Guild under Groll. Twelve years producing potions the traditional way—slow, inconsistent, expensive.
```

**Replacement**:
```
Marcus moved through the process with mechanical precision.

A decade in the old Guild under Groll. Twelve years producing potions the traditional way—slow, inconsistent, expensive.
```

**Reason**: Varies phrasing to avoid repetition

**Status**: APPROVED
