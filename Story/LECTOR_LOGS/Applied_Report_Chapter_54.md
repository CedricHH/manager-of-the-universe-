## Strengths

1. **Sarah Chen Introduction**: Effective new character — sharp, principled, provides human emotional counterweight to Victor's detachment
2. **Key Exchange**: "I'm already destroyed. I just haven't stopped moving yet." — Quotable, character-defining line
3. **Timeline Calculation**: Victor explaining his 29-hour survival window to Chen demonstrates his complete acceptance
4. **Forty-Seven Minutes**: The meeting length matching the victim count is subtle but powerful symbolism
5. **Present Day Return**: Victor realizes the aftermath — the board went to prison, the case became a textbook example. His death meant something.
6. **ARMI Memory Warning**: 84% integration complete — effective psychological tracking

## Summary

The penultimate flashback chapter delivers the emotional core of Victor's pre-reincarnation arc. The meeting with Sarah Chen provides necessary human contrast — she feels the weight that Victor cannot. The survival probability calculations ("29 hours, optimistically") reinforce Victor's complete acceptance of death. The return to present day confirms the outcome (board imprisoned, ethics textbook case) while maintaining the death itself as the final unprocessed memory.

Strong setup for Chapter 55's climactic flashback.

**Recommendation**: No changes required. Proceed to Chapter 55 (The Death).
