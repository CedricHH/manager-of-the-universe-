## Change Applied

### Enhancement: Added Internal Doubt (Lines 376-381)
**Status**: ✅ APPLIED

**Before:**
> He smiled.
>
> "Good thing arbitrage doesn't require partners."

**After:**
> He smiled.
>
> Twenty-three trades in twenty-five days. Each one had to succeed. No margin for error. One failed transaction, and the shortfall would compound.
>
> But partnerships were blocked. Arbitrage wasn't.
>
> "Good thing arbitrage doesn't require partners."

**Rationale**: Adds emotional weight; shows Victor acknowledges high-stakes risk before confident pivot
