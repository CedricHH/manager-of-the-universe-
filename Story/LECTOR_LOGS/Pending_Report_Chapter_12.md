## Issues
| Line | Type | Problem | Suggested Fix | Status |
|------|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| 172 | Typo | "seven days" lowercase at start of dialogue | Capitalize: "Seven days" | PENDING |
| 180 | Clarity | "suicidal adventurers" may be too strong | Consider "risk-seeking adventurers" | OPTIONAL |

## Continuity Check

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Timeline | ✅ | Deadline extended from 3 days → 7 days (Sir Kael's sword tribute) |
| Employee Count | ✅ | 26 goblins implied |
| Oakhaven Distance | ✅ | "Five leagues" = ~15 miles - reasonable |

## Logic & Math Check

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Deadline extension | ✅ | 3 days → 7 days in exchange for sword (down payment) |
| Guard references | ✅ | "Silver Dawn" 50 years ago - consistent |
| Fire-Stick location | ⚠️ | Mentioned as "glowing sword" but called "Fire-Stick" - ensure name consistency |
