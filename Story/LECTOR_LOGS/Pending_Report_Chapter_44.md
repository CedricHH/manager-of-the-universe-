## Overview
An intense, high-stakes chapter that effectively translates corporate themes into a literal siege battle. The introduction of "Corporate Shield" for Asterion and the "Hostile Takeover" counter-hack for Victor are brilliant additions to their skillsets. The twist—that the physical assault was just a delivery mechanism for a magical override—is well-foreshadowed and perfectly fits Groll's character.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 117 | Terminology: "billing by the hour" vs "fighting for equity". | Excellent thematic contrast. | OK |
| 147 | New Skill: [SKILL: CORPORATE SHIELD] | Ensure this is added to Asterion's file (or World/System docs). | PENDING SYNC |
| 251 | New Skill: [SKILL: HOSTILE TAKEOVER] | Update Victor's file. | PENDING SYNC |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The "Acid Slimes" as waste disposal units is a great continuity nod to Chapter 43.
- The pacing from the breach to the hack is breakneck, keeping the tension high.
