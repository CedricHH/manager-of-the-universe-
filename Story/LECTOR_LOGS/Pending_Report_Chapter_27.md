## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| - | Word Count Deficit | The chapter needs expansion (approx. 450 words). Suggest expanding the internal analysis of the Core's history or adding a scene of Victor preparing before entering the chamber. | PENDING |

## Observations
- The concept of "Dungeon as a failing business" is perfectly articulated here.
- The Core's "Resentment" provides a good emotional hook.
- Mention of the "Galactic Audit Consortium" ties back to the series premise and keeps the meta-stakes high.
- ARMI interaction is used well to provide data.

## Proposed Fix (Expansion)
- Add a prologue scene where Victor reflects on his own past failures as a restructurer on Earth, contrasting them with the current opportunity.
- Expand the Core's "memory download" scene—describe some of its failed administrators in more detail.
- Add more detail to the "Equity Partnership" negotiation to make it feel more hard-fought.
