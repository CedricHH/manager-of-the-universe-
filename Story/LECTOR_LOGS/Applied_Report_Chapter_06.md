## Detailed Analysis

### Hook Quality (8/10)

**Strength**: Opens with immediate conflict—two goblins fighting, blood visible.

**Minor Issue**: Could be slightly more visceral in the first line.

No changes needed.

### Pacing (9/10)

**Strength**: 
- Paragraphs are mobile-optimized (1-3 sentences)
- Clear scene breaks with `---` dividers
- Action progresses every 100-200 words

No issues found.

### Voice Consistency (9/10)

**Strength**:
- Victor's corporate metaphors consistent ("teaching moment", "chain of command")
- ARMI messages use proper bureaucratic tone
- Sniv's dialogue evolving naturally ("Ma-na-ger")

**Examples**:
> *This is why we can't have nice things.*
> *Organization beats chaos. Always.*

Voice is distinctive and recognizable.

### Cliffhanger (8/10)

**Strength**: "Tomorrow, we take Floor Three" is a clear promise of action.

**Minor Issue**: Could add one more beat of tension—perhaps a roar from Asterion or a glimpse of the hostile goblins watching.

Optional enhancement, not required.

### Word Count (8/10)

- **Actual**: 1,571 words
- **Target**: 1,500-1,800 words
- **Status**: PASS

### Competence Display (9/10)

Victor demonstrates mastery through:
1. De-escalating the fight without violence
2. Creating organizational structure (org chart)
3. Adapting communication (numbers → candle system)
4. Strategic assessment (14 vs 14 fighting-capable)
5. Making decisive expansion decision

Multiple "competence porn" moments throughout.
