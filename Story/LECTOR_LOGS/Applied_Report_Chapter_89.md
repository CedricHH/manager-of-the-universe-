## Issues

| Line/Section | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| N/A | No critical issues | - | APPROVED |

---

## Minor Polish Recommendations (APPROVED)

### 1. **Line 47-48** (Minor stylistic improvement)
**Current**:
```
"You mean like the Church sells? Fifty thousand gold. Maybe more if there's a drought. Why? You planning to become a priest?"
```

**Issue**: Barnaby's dialogue is good but could punch harder with his characteristic chaos.

**Suggested**:
```
"You mean like the Church sells? Fifty thousand gold, bare minimum. Last drought, they charged noble houses a hundred and twenty thousand—each! Private rain, guaranteed delivery. Why, Boss? You converting to the clergy? Want me to find you a fancy hat?"
```

**Rationale**: Adds specificity and reinforces Barnaby's merchant insider knowledge.

**Status**: APPROVED (Optional)

---

### 2. **Exchange Listing Format** (Clarity enhancement)
**Current**: Multiple different listing formats used

**Issue**: Minor inconsistency in how listings display. Sometimes includes "Note:", sometimes doesn't.

**Suggested**: Standardize all Exchange listings to same format:
```
> **Listing #XXX-XXX**
> **Seller:** [Entity Name] (World XX-X)
> **Item:** [Item Name] (Tier X Type)
> **Price:** X,XXX GP
> **Note:** "[Seller comment]"
```

**Rationale**: Makes the Exchange feel like a consistent UI/UX system.

**Status**: APPROVED (Cosmetic only)

---

### 3. **Cliffhanger Enhancement** (Final paragraph boost)
**Current**:
```
And someone had known exactly when he'd be on this road.
```

**Issue**: Strong ending, but could add one more line for impact.

**Suggested Addition**:
```
And someone had known exactly when he'd be on this road.

Someone who knew his deadline.
```

**Rationale**: Ties the ambush back to the 30-day contract, raising stakes further (conspiracy implication).

**Status**: APPROVED

### ARMI System Messages
**Status**: ✅ **CORRECT FORMAT**

All messages follow the established blockquote + bold format from STYLE_GUIDE.md.

Both create urgency for next chapter.

## Summary

Chapter 89 delivers a masterclass in Victor's competence, introducing the Galactic Exchange arbitrage mechanic through organic exploration, clear system limitations, and meaningful consequences. The dual-threat cliffhanger (strategic warning + physical ambush) creates immediate urgency. Voice, pacing, and worldbuilding all exceed standards. Recommended changes are cosmetic polish only.

**Next Chapter Expectation**: "The Liquidation Protocols" - Victor vs. coordinated bandit force; likely reveals who's tracking him.
