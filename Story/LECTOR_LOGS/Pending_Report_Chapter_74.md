## Final Verdict

**PASS ✓ (59/60 - 98.3%)**

Chapter 74 executes excellently. The cultural phenomenon is tangible (merchandise, broadcasts, gambling). The three-guild threat structure gives each antagonist distinct character. The coordinated boycott feels like genuine escalation. Victor's counter-strategy (employee matches) is brilliant—turns crisis into opportunity while showcasing his unique asset (monster employees). Minor word count shortfall (<1%) doesn't impact quality.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to sync phase. No changes required.
