# Lector Report: Chapter 81 - The Imperial Onboarding

## 1. Verdict: **PASS** (Score: 57/60)

| Criteria | Score | Observations |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Hook** | 10/10 | The comparison between the obsidian carriage and a first-class lounge immediately sets the tone for the "High Corporate" stage of the story. |
| **Pacing** | 9/10 | The discussion about the "Grey Spires" and the Mana-Rail briefing provides necessary worldbuilding without slowing down the narrative. |
| **Voice** | 10/10 | Victor's clinical detachment and focus on "data-latency" and "Total Audit Atmosphere" are spot-on. |
| **Cliffhanger** | 9/10 | The arrival at Aethelgard and the mention of rival Senior Partners sets up the political stakes. |
| **Style Guide** | 10/10 | Correct ARMI formatting. Jargon used effectively ("Data-latency", "ROI", "Liquidity Crisis"). |
| **Continuity** | 9/10 | Seamlessly transitions from the Oakhaven departure. Introduces the Imperial Bureau of Audit convincingly. |

## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### Strengths
- **Worldbuilding**: The Imperial Mana-Rail and the verticality of Aethelgard provide a sense of scale that effectively signals the transition to Act 2.
- **Vane's Character**: He continues to be a great mentor/rival figure, speaking Victor's language of "Total Audit."
- **Corporate Mirroring**: The dialogue about "Punishing Inefficiency" vs "Punishing Sin" is a core thematic hook for this arc.

### Minor Suggestions
- **Rival Partners**: A brief glimpse of one of the rival partners (Hestia or Thorne) in the distance might have added a bit more immediate tension, but the mention by Vane is sufficient for now.
- **The Obsidian Gargoyles**: A nice touch with the "compliance-light" eyes.
