## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 |
| Pacing | 10/10 |
| Voice | 10/10 |
| Cliffhanger | 8/10 |
| Word Count | 10/10 (1509 words) |

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 125 | "Level 25 boss fight" | Change to "Level 20 boss fight" to match consistency with Ch 21 (Line 51). | PENDING |
| 7 | "Level 25+ strength enhancement" | Keep as force assessment, but aware it might confuse with the level discrepancy in line 125. | NOTE |

## Observations
- Excellent use of corporate metaphors for the battle (e.g., "Bron hit a pillar at roughly the speed of market enthusiasm after a dividend cut").
- Consistent character names following Ch 21 fixes.
- Strategic deployment of ARMI messages.
