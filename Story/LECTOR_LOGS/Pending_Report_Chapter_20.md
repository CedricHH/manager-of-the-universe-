|---------|-------------------|----------------|--------|

| Anomaly flag | "Altruistic self-termination" | Victor_Kaine.md: "exchanged personal existence for external benefit" | ✅ CONSISTENT |

### Combat Math

| Event | Math Check | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Asterion Level | Ch 16: 32, Ch 20: 20 mentioned | ⚠️ INCONSISTENCY (see below) |

## Issues

| Line | Type | Problem | Suggested Fix | Status |
|------|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| 69 | **CRITICAL** | "Asterion was Level 20" contradicts Ch 16 which showed Level 32 | Standardize: Either fix Ch 16 to 20 OR fix Ch 20 to 32 | ⚠️ FIX NEEDED |
| 45 | Minor Clarification | "That's three spell slots" - Victor counting Alara's resources | Good tactical thinking | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| 61 | Minor | "clawed fingers" - Victor has claws? | Metaphorical (gripping tightly) or literal? | CLARIFY |
| 151-160 | Lore | Consortium recruitment message shown | New canonical lore - consistent with established backstory | ✅ EXCELLENT |

## Level Inconsistency Analysis

| Source | Asterion Level | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Chapter 16 (Performance Review) | **32** | ARMI scan data |
| Chapter 20 (Narration) | **20** | "Asterion was Level 20" |
| Asterion.md (Character File) | **20 (base)** | "Level: 20 (Arc 1) → 22 (Ch 70+) → 32 (Arc 2)" |

**Verdict**: Chapter 16 incorrectly shows Level 32 (which is Arc 2 level). At this point in story (Arc 1, Ch 16-20), Asterion should be **Level 20**.

**Required Fix**: Correct Chapter 16's ARMI display from Level 32 to Level 20.

## Style Guide Compliance

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Victor's analytical voice | ✅ "Dignity reduced by forty percent" |
| Corporate jargon as magic | ✅ "performing above expectations", "annual performance review" |
| 2+ ARMI messages | ✅ 3 messages |
| Cliffhanger ending | ✅ "Do you have an appointment?" - EXCELLENT |
| No banned phrases | ✅ None detected |
| Mobile-optimized paragraphs | ✅ Good structure |

---

## Recommendations

1. **CRITICAL**: Fix Asterion's level in Chapter 16 from 32 to 20
2. **Minor**: Line 61 "clawed fingers" could be clarified (Victor is human)
3. **Minor**: The Consortium recruitment sequence is excellent worldbuilding

---

**Verdict**: APPROVED - Asterion level fixed in Ch 16 (32→20), "clawed fingers" fixed.
