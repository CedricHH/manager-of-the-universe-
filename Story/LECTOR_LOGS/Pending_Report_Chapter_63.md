# Lector Report: Chapter 63

## 1. Overview
- **Chapter**: 63 - The Gilded Ledger
- **Word Count**: ~1,500
- **Status**: [PENDING]

## 2. Qualitative Analysis
- **Tone**: The shift to "High Finance Fantasy" works perfectly. The description of the bank as a "cathedral of wealth" parallels the Church, reinforcing the theme that Money is a Faith.
- **Character Voice**:
    - **Malcom**: Cold, ancient, calculating. The "High Elf Banker" trope is a nice twist on the usual forest-dweller.
    - **Victor**: "I don't sell pieces of myself." Shows his ego/pride.
- **Plot mechanics**: "Loot Futures" is a brilliant concept for a Manager-class protagonist. It turns standard RPG rewards into financial derivatives.

## 3. Issues & Fixes
| ID | Severity | Issue | Proposed Fix | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 01 | Minor | 10,000 GP feels like a small amount for a "Pilot Tranche" given the dungeon's scale. | Keep it. It's enough for immediate expansion (Floor 4) but keeps him hungry for the full 50k. | [IGNORE] |
| 02 | Minor | Malcom's motivation to collude with Aurelia isn't purely logical yet. | Add a line in his internal monologue about "Stability". The Bank hates Chaos (which Victor represents). | [APPROVED] |

## 4. Implementation Plan
- **Fix 02**: Add internal monologue to Malcom's final scene clarifying why he helps the Church (Stability > Profit).

## 5. Sync Triggers
- **New Faction**: Gilded Ledger (Bank).
- **New Character**: Director Malcom.
- **New Asset**: 10,000 GP (Liquid).
- **New Liability**: Loot Futures Contract (20% of Rare/Epic drops).
- **Plot**: Bank/Church collusion revealed to reader (not Victor).
