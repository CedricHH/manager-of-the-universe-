# Lector Analysis: Chapter 05

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 | "The Alpha Rat finished its second helping..." Immediate resolution to Ch 4 action. |
| Pacing | 9/10 | Transition from survival to management. Good flashback integration. |
| Voice | 10/10 | "Pest control through payroll." "Structure creates output." Victor's philosophy is solid. |
| Cliffhanger | 10/10 | Asterion (Level 20 Boss) wakes up. Massive threat established. |
| Word Count | 10/10 | ~1,780 words (Target: 1,500-2,000). |
| **Overall** | **9.6/10** | **Excellent consolidation chapter.** |

## Consistencies & Logic
- **Character**: Victor's immediate pivot to "Org Charts" and "Cleanliness" highlights his need for control.
- **Plot**: The "Deficit: 1" in ARMI hints at the constant pressure of resource management.
- **Tone**: The dream sequence adds needed depth to Victor's motivation ("Who was Sarah?").

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 3-33 | Math: 15 Jellies collected (Ch 4). Usage: 1 (Sniv) + 2 (Rat "second helping"?) + 13 (dumped) = 16. Calculation off by 1. | Updated Ch 4 to "16 Jellies" collected. Math now balances (16 - 3 = 13). | FIXED |
| 216 | Logic: "Assets: 0 Slime Jelly (Deficit: 1)". If 13 jellies fed 13 remaining goblins (assuming Sniv fed), everyone ate. Deficit might refer to Rat's maintenance? Unclear. | Correct as stands: 13 jellies vs 14 total workforce = 1 deficit. | FIXED |
