## Strengths

### 1. Conceptual Brilliance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The entire chapter is built on the idea of "weaponized compliance":
- Victor doesn't avoid the audit—he makes it perfect
- Turns defensive situation into offensive opportunity
- The mosquito farm becomes *registered livestock*
- 500-page binder as psychological warfare

### 2. Character Introduction: Thaddeus Crow ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Excellent new antagonist:
- "Thin, pale, wire-rimmed spectacles, black suit"
- Emotionless, robotic delivery
- Truth Detection briefcase
- Perfect foil to Victor (by-the-book vs creative interpretation)
- His eye twitches = tells

### 3. Corporate Satire Escalation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This chapter takes the satire to new heights:
- "Signature in blood" courier
- Goblin union "for tax purposes"
- Slime pH logs in three languages
- "Minotaur-related Incidents" insurance
- *Crown v. Beekeepers Guild* (1391) precedent

### 4. Three-Act Structure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Perfectly paced:
- **Act 1**: Threat introduction + preparation montage
- **Act 2**: Floor-by-floor inspection (escalating absurdity)
- **Act 3**: The counterattack (loan proposal)

### 5. ARMI Integration ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Excellent use of system:
- Three-scenario probability analysis
- ROI calculation (7,450% return on compliance investment)
- Shows Victor's mental process
- Justifies the aggressive counter-strategy

### 6. Comedy Through Competence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Genuinely funny moments:
- Valerius hiding under desk
- Sniv's helmet (upside-down but compliant)
- Asterion: "The break room has coffee now. I am... content."
- Crow's hands trembling at the mosquito farm
- "Why not both?"

---

## World Building

### New Elements Introduced:
1. **Clause 89-F** - Compliance Inspection clause (audit weapon)
2. **Thaddeus Crow** - Bank auditor character
3. **Bank of Sterling** - Competitor bank (leverage)
4. **Goblin Union** - Labor organization for tax purposes
5. **Crown v. Beekeepers Guild (1391)** - Property law precedent
6. **Loot Futures 2.0** - Second loan product
7. **Floor 5 teaser** - Volcanic Biome expansion plan

---

## Thematic Progression

### Bank War Arc (Ch 65-66):
- **Ch 65**: Victor neutralizes mosquito surveillance
- **Ch 66**: Victor turns audit into expansion opportunity

**Escalation pattern**: Each chapter, Victor doesn't just defend—he gains ground.

**Malcom's perspective**: 
- Started with surveillance advantage
- Lost mosquitoes
- Now forced to either fund Victor or lose him to competitors

Perfect antagonist escalation. ✅

## Summary

Chapter 66 is an **excellent** continuation of the Bank war arc. Victor demonstrates his core philosophy: "offense disguised as compliance." The introduction of Thaddeus Crow provides a memorable new character, and the floor-by-floor inspection sequence is both funny and engaging.

The chapter:
- Continues naturally from Ch 65's escalation
- Introduces a competent new antagonist (Crow)
- Delivers satisfying "face-slapping" via perfect compliance
- Sets up future conflict organically (bidding war)
- Exceeds all technical requirements

**The mosquito farm payoff**: Using *Crown v. Beekeepers Guild* to justify farming the Bank's surveillance is chef's kiss-level writing.

**Recommendation**: APPROVE FOR PUBLICATION

**Next Steps**:
1. Sync character/world files via `/sync-from-chapter`
2. Git commit
3. Proceed to Ch 67 (Malcom's response)
