## Issues

| Line | Type | Problem | Suggested Fix | Status |
|------|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| 11 | Minor Continuity | "Tell me your plan... And I'll decide whether to eat you or listen" - slight paraphrase of Ch 16 ending | Exact quote match not required; paraphrase acceptable | NO FIX NEEDED |
| 69 | Level Data | Contract says "Level 15+" worthy opponent | Consistent with outline | ✅ CORRECT |
| - | Missing | No mention of Sniv being present during negotiation | Consistent with Ch 16 (Victor descended alone) | ✅ CORRECT |

## Style Guide Compliance

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Victor's analytical voice | ✅ "You are operating at a hundred percent loss" |
| Corporate jargon as magic | ✅ "nuclear option", "structurally redundant", "rebrand" |
| 2+ ARMI messages | ✅ 5 messages |
| Cliffhanger ending | ✅ "We're going to advertise" |
| No banned phrases | ✅ None detected |
| Mobile-optimized paragraphs | ✅ Mostly 1-3 sentence paragraphs |

## Recommendations

1. **Minor**: Consider adding a brief transition at the start to clarify Victor is still in Asterion's chamber
2. **Optional**: The 30-day deadline could be emphasized slightly more for tension

**Verdict**: APPROVED - No critical fixes required.
