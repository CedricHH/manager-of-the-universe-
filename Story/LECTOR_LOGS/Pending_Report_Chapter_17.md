## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| - | **CRITICAL: Duplication** | This chapter is a narrative duplicate of Chapter 16 (Aggressive Negotiations). Both chapters cover the negotiation and contract signing with Asterion. | Recommend merging or deleting Chapter 17 and replacing it with the "Training/Iron Wolves" scene as per the Plot Outline. | PENDING |
| 14-18 | System Message Inconsistency | Chapter 16 used a different [ARMI] format (more like a terminal). This one uses a list format. | Standardize to the terminal format defined in ARMI_System.md. | PENDING |
| 65-71 | Contract Duplication | The contract [The Guardian's Pact] was already signed in Chapter 16. | Remove contract signing or frame it as a "Confirmation Audit". | PENDING |
| 157-160 | Continuity Drift | Chapter 16 ended with the Iron Wolves entering. Chapter 17 ends with a plan to "advertise". | Align endings: The plan to advertise should be interrupted by the Iron Wolves' arrival. | PENDING |

## Continuity Notes
- Asterion's attitude matches the "bored boss" trope.
- Victor's corporate vocabulary is consistent.
- The 30-day deadline is consistent with the Arc 1 goals.
