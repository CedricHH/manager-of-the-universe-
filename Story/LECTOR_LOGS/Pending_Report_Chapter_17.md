## 🛑 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

### 1. Word Count Exceeds Target
- **Problem**: 1,881 words. Target is 1,500-1,800.
- **Location**: Entire chapter
- **Fix**: Trim 81-100 words from descriptive passages

---

## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES

| Line | Problem | Suggested Fix | Status |
|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| 3 | Opening sentence is long (38 words) | Split into two sentences | PENDING |
| 100-102 | Climbing description slows pacing | Compress to 1-2 sentences | PENDING |
| 166-170 | "Ownership" reflection is slightly too long | Trim to core emotion | PENDING |

---

## ✅ WHAT WORKED

- **Negotiation Scene**: Victor vs Asterion dialogue is tense and well-paced
- **Corporate Jargon**: "Liquidate the asset", "rebrand", "manufacture demand" - excellent voice
- **Handshake Moment**: Great character beat showing Victor imposing his worldview
