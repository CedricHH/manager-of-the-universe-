## Observations
- **Voice**: Victor's "Scheduled Maintenance" explanation for giving goblins a day off is quintessential Victor—managing to be humane only by framing it as a cold business necessity.
- **Lore**: The introduction of "Pre-Dungeon" structures adds a layer of mystery to the world beyond the LitRPG mechanics.
- **Satire**: The "post-apocalyptic middle management" aesthetic of his office is a great detail.
- **Math**: 110 GP budget - 30 (Traps) - 40 (Mining) = 40 GP remaining. Math is consistent with the text.
- **Continuity**: The "Silver Lance" equipment being sold in Chapter 30 is referenced indirectly via the "premium loot" concept here.

## Final Verdict
Chapter is excellent and requires no fixes. Proceed to sync.
