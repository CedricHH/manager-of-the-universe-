| Pacing | 10/10 | Mobile-optimized; dialogue-driven legal warfare |
| Voice | 10/10 | Perfect Victor - weaponizes bureaucracy, not combat |

### Quick Score

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|

| Pacing | 9/10 | Transaction montage flows well; capital drain creates tension |
| Voice | 10/10 | "I turned money into infrastructure" - perfect Victor |  
| Cliffhanger | 10/10 | Triple threat convergence (G.A.C. + Church + Coalition) |
| Word Count | 9/10 | 2,344 words (slightly over, but justified by complexity) |

**TOTAL:** 55/60

**Verdict:** ✅ **PASS** - Solid infrastructure chapter

### Strengths

4. **Capital Pressure**: Spending 25k GP on clearance fee = real sacrifice

### Minor Issues

| Issue | Fix | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Transaction montage (lines 90-130) could use MORE sensory detail | Add 1-2 sentences: Barnaby's confusion, caravan ambiance | APPROVED |

| Hestia's audit explanation feels like exposition dump | Break into dialogue exchange with Victor asking questions | APPROVED |

4. **Asset Liquidation**: Sacrificing capital for infrastructure perfectly in-character
5. **Debt Ending**: Ending chapter at -15k GP creates tension for next arc

### Minor Issues

| Issue | Fix | Status |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Cassia's "Thank you" scene could linger LONGER | Add 2-3 sentences: Victor's internal conflict, suppressed emotion | APPROVED |
| Divine voice could use more personality | Add bemused tone: "YOUR AUDACITY IS... REFRESHING" | APPROVED |
