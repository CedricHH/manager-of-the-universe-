## 1. Verdict: **PASS** (Score: 56/60)

| Criteria | Score | Observations |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Hook** | 10/10 | The shift from damp leather to floor wax and silence immediately sets the "new management" tone. |
| **Pacing** | 9/10 | The three-part negotiation (Groll, Kael, Church) is well-structured. |
| **Voice** | 10/10 | Victor's "Gods don't need real estate. Institutions do" is an iconic corporate-cynical line. |
| **Cliffhanger** | 9/10 | The transition to Act 2 and the "Corporate Restructuring" quest is a strong hook for the next arc. |
| **Style Guide** | 10/10 | Perfect ARMI blockquote formatting. No banned phrases detected. |
| **Continuity** | 10/10 | Seamlessly handles the insurance payout and the land deed plot threads. |

## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### Strengths
- **The "Landlord of the Cathedral" play**: This is a brilliant escalation of the corporate-vs-fantasy theme.
- **Sniv's development**: Sniv wearing a suit vest and glasses while managing phosphorescent moss installation is great comic relief.
- **The "Severance Package" terminology**: Using debt-equity swaps as a "solution" for the antagonists makes Victor feel like a real predatory CEO.

### Minor Suggestions
- **Word Count**: The chapter is currently at ~1,380 words, which is slightly below the 1,500-word target. A few more details on the "Public Safety narrative" or the "Urban Development Trust" backstory would fix this.
- **Kael's decision**: A moment of Kael looking at his hammer and realizing its "inventory value" would reinforce the corporate gaze.
