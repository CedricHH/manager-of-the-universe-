1 AM. Adventurer's Quarter.
[Full Sniv/Kael interaction]
[Progress tracker: 1 AM, 2 AM, 3 AM updates]
[Three sample testimonials]
By 4 AM, Sniv had 487...
```

**Condensed Version** (100 words shorter):
```
1 AM. Adventurer's Quarter. Sniv's goblin team went door-to-door.

Knock. Wake. Explain. Sign.

"You save forty silver per potion at Insolvia shop!" Sniv told bleary-eyed adventurers. "Guild trying to shut down! Sign paper, tell Council you want cheap potions!"

Results came fast. By 4 AM: 487 signed testimonials.

Sample: "I can afford pre-dungeon health potions now. Used to skip them because fifty silver was too expensive. This saved my life last week." — Kael, Level 6 Fighter

Target exceeded.
