## Strengths

1. **Elena Cross Introduction** (EXCEPTIONAL): Professional, competent, not caricature. "Guild protection of commerce" establishes smart character.
2. **Economic Warfare Setup**: Alchemist Cartel = perfect antagonist for Victor's skillset
3. **Mystery Hook**: Previous Restructurer disappearance (16 years) creates long-term plot thread
4. **Alliance Formation**: Guild partnership feels earned, mutual benefit clear
5. **Power Mapping**: Victor's end-of-chapter assessment lists all factions perfectly

## Minor Issues

None requiring changes. Chapter is publication-ready.
