|------|---------|-----|--------|
| N/A | Word count (2130) slightly exceeds target (2000). | Acceptable due to necessary flashback and negotiation detail. No trim needed. | IGNORE |

## Summary
A strong chapter that perfectly executes the "Corporate Warfare" theme, successfully integrating the backstory flashback ("The Decision") with the current plot negotiation. Victor's competence is high, and the cliffhanger sets up the next conflict well.

## Change Log
