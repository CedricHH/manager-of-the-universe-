## Overview
A standout chapter that bridges Victor's past and present through parallel boardroom experiences. The emotional weight of the "Worth it" flashback provides critical depth to Victor's otherwise clinical character. The hiring of Kael and Mira establishes a needed security layer for Oakhaven operations.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 185 | Continuity: Kael and Mira Level 12. | Sync character files (if existing) or note for future. | PENDING SYNC |
| 101 | Protocol: Guild Censure mechanism. | Ensure this penalty is consistent in future Guild-related conflicts. | NOTE |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The transition between the flashback and the current moment (Line 165) is effective, using a physical "blink" to ground the reader.
- The use of ARMI to calculate "Public Opinion Shift" (Line 225) is a great example of corporate logic applied to social dynamics.
