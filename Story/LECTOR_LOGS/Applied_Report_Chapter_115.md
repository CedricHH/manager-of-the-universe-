**Development (lines 43-245)**: 
- Beat 1 (Boardroom negotiation): Good tension building
- Beat 2 (Death mark reveal): Excellent dramatic peak
- Beat 3 (Kieran leverage): Satisfying character manipulation

**Cliffhanger (lines 246-end)**: Perfect escalation - vanguard arriving before coalition fully deploys.

## Summary

Chapter 115 executes its outline beats effectively. The death mark revelation provides strong character credibility moment. The Kieran betrayal subplot demonstrates Victor's competence at converting threats into assets. The Merchant Coalition negotiation feels authentic with distinct character voices. The vanguard cliffhanger creates immediate tactical pressure for next chapter.

Word count slightly elevated (2,070 vs 2,000) but justified by negotiation complexity and multiple character interactions. No significant revisions needed.

**Recommended Action**: Accept as-is and proceed to sync phase.
