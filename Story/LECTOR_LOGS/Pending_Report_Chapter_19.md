# Lector Analysis: Chapter 19

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 | Strong visual contrast ("pit was brown"). Immediate engagement. |
| Pacing | 9/10 | Fluid transition between present and flashback. Mobile-friendly paragraphs. |
| Voice | 10/10 | Victor's corporate breakdown of the "Sunk Cost" of killing adventurers is perfect. |
| Cliffhanger | 9/10 | High tension ("Objective: Survive"). |
| Word Count | 10/10 | 1,585 words (Target: 1,500-2,000). Perfect. |

## Continuity & Logic
- **Math Check**: Silver Lance Party (Levels 12, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15) = 75 Total. Average 12.5. **PERFECT**.
- **Timeline**: Flashback "12 Months Ago" aligns correctly with Chapter 18's "18 Months Ago" timeline (approx 6 months post-scandal).
- **Character Implementation**: Sniv's reluctance to use non-lethal traps fits his goblin nature perfectly.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 21 | Phrasing: "deeply wrapped" is awkward for physical objects. | Change to **"thickly wrapped"** or **"heavily padded"**. | FIXED |
| 135 | Style Violation: "His heart was hammering..." is effectively "His heart raced" (Banned). | Change to: **"His pulse spiked to 140 BPM. Adrenaline flushed his system."** (Victor's Voice) | FIXED |
| 144 | Cliché: "As if on cue" is generic narrative glue. | Remove it. Just have the sound happen. **"A chiming sound echoed..."** | FIXED |
| 179 | Character Voice: Victor touching Sniv (hand on shoulder) is rare. | Ensure this is a calculated morale-boosting gesture, not just casual comfort. (Acceptable context here). | NOTE |
