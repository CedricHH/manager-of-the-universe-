| Kaelie | ~13 | Mage | Returning from Ch 15 |
| Finn | ~11 | Rogue | Called "Halfling" (was not specified before) |

## Issues

| Line | Type | Problem | Suggested Fix | Status |
|------|------|---------|---------------|--------|
| 77 | Minor Name | "Mira" mentioned in Ch 15 outline, but party uses "Kaelie" as mage | Kaelie is consistent with Ch 15 chapter text | ✅ CONSISTENT |
| 146 | Threat Level | ARMI says "Level 10-15 Average" but lists Alara as Level 15 | Math checks out (10+13+11+10+15+14)/6 = 12.2 avg | ✅ CORRECT |
| 171 | Math | "Combined Level: 75 (Average: 12.5)" | Actual: ~73. Minor rounding difference | NO FIX NEEDED |
| 160-165 | New Characters | Alara and Bron introduced | Should be added to Silver_Lance.md if exists | ⚠️ SYNC NEEDED |

---

## Style Guide Compliance

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Victor's analytical voice | ✅ "Farming their ego" |
| Corporate jargon as magic | ✅ "sunk cost", "retention value" |
| 2+ ARMI messages | ✅ 3 messages |
| Cliffhanger ending | ✅ "Status: Combat Mode Engaged. Objective: Survive." |
| No banned phrases | ✅ None detected |
| Mobile-optimized paragraphs | ✅ Good structure |

---

## Recommendations

1. **SYNC**: Update Silver Lance character file (if exists) to include Alara and Bron
2. **Minor**: The flashback with Sarah is effective setup for Ch 20

---

**Verdict**: APPROVED - No critical fixes required. Sync recommended.
