## Strengths

1. **Gorvak Negotiation**: "When Thessara's Serpent expands to Floor 15..." = leverages competitor pressure perfectly
2. **1,022,000 GP Reveal**: Satisfying payoff for 23-day sprint
3. **Tax Leverage**: Victor using 47k GP taxes to avoid arrest = brilliant pragmatism
4. **Veyra's Respect**: "First Restructurer who turned probation into profit" = character growth acknowledged
5. **Arc 2 Tease**: 10M GP target + expansion objectives = sets next phase
6. **Transformation Note**: "Arrived as dungeoneer, leaving as tycoon" = perfect character arc summary

## Areas for Enhancement

### Issue 1: Word Count (56 words short)

**Recommendation**: Expand **Gorvak negotiation scene** (add 30 words) + **Final reflection scene** (add 30 words)

**Why these scenes?**
- Gorvak negotiation: High-stakes, deserves more tension
- Final reflection: Emotional payoff for Arc 1 completion

---

### Issue 2: Rushed Finale Pacing

The chapter moves quickly through major beats:
- Core Seed sale (good length)
- 1M GP achievement (could expand +20 words for emotional weight)
- Imperial arrest (good)
- Veyra ruling (good)
- Arc 2 setup (slightly rushed)

**Suggested Enhancement Locations:**

#### Location A: After "1,022,000 GP" Reveal (Line ~100)

**Current:**
> **One million twenty-two thousand gold pieces.**
>
> He'd done it.

**Enhanced (+30 words):**
> **One million twenty-two thousand gold pieces.**
>
> He'd done it.
>
> Thirty days ago, he'd stood in this same chamber with zero capital, a failing dungeon, and one desperate chance. The Consortium had given him an impossible deadline. Every expert said it couldn't be done.
>
> And yet.

**Rationale**: Adds emotional weight to achievement; shows contrast between starting point and victory

---

#### Location B: Gorvak Negotiation - Add Tension Beat (Line ~50)

**Current:**
> Long pause.
>
> The obsidian crystal's glow intensified, dimmed, intensified again. Gorvak calculating.
>
> "220,000. Final offer."

**Enhanced (+30 words):**
> Long pause.
>
> The obsidian crystal's glow intensified, dimmed, intensified again. Gorvak calculating profit margins, expansion timelines, competitive advantage.
>
> Victor didn't move. Didn't speak. Let silence do the work.
>
> Market pressure was a more effective negotiator than any argument he could make.
>
> "220,000. Final offer."

**Rationale**: Adds negotiation tension; shows Victor's strategic patience
