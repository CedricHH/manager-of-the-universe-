## Observations
- Emotional beats regarding the liquidation of the hero's sword are surprisingly effective, highlighting the shift from "Fantasy Story" to "Business Management."
- The reveal of the "Galactic Audit Consortium" monitoring Victor keeps the stakes high and aligns with the Arc 1.2 conclusion.
- Consistent characterization of Zip as a "recreative deconstructionist."
