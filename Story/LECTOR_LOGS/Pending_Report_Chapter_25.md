## ✅ WHAT WORKED

1. **The sword sacrifice** - Destroying Marcus's sword for capital is peak corporate pragmatism
2. **Core negotiation** - The "filing fee" bureaucracy is perfectly on-brand
3. **Dungeon renaming** to "Insolvia Holdings" is chef's kiss
4. **Consortium reveal** sets up future arc tension without over-explaining

---

**VERDICT**: Excellent arc finale. Victor graduates from squatter to administrator, while cosmic forces take notice.
