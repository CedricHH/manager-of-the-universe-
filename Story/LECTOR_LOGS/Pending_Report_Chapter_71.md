## Detailed Analysis

### Hook Quality (9/10)

**Strengths**:
- Immediate tension: "By sunset, Director Malcom... was reading the same poster with visible anger"
- Quantified success: "twelve parties had registered"
- Establishes stakes quickly with the poster format

**Minor Issue**:
- Line: "The first Ember Trials poster went up in Oakhaven's Adventurer District at dawn."
- **Problem**: Slightly passive "went up" - could be more active
- **Suggested Fix**: "Victor posted the first Ember Trials announcement in Oakhaven's Adventurer District at dawn."
- **Status**: OPTIONAL (current version is fine, but this would be stronger)

---

### Pacing (9/10)

**Strengths**:
- Perfect mobile formatting (1-3 sentence paragraphs)

**Strengths**:

- Final line creates immediate tension: "Invitation to Audit"

## Suggested Improvements (Optional)

### Optional Edit #1: Hook Strengthening

**Current** (Line 1):
```
The first Ember Trials poster went up in Oakhaven's Adventurer District at dawn.
```

**Suggested**:
```
Victor posted the first Ember Trials announcement in Oakhaven's Adventurer District at dawn.
```

**Reason**: More active voice, attributes action to Victor
**Status**: OPTIONAL

Chapter 71 executes flawlessly. Strong tournament launch, excellent revenue innovation demonstration, perfect Victor voice, multiple ARMI integrations, and a multi-layered cliffhanger with concrete deadline.
