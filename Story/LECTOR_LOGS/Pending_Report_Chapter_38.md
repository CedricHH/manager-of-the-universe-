## Overview
A strong chapter establishing the next phase of the Oakhaven arc. The introduction of Elena Cross as a professional foil to Victor works well, and the "Missing Restructurer" mystery provides a compelling long-term hook. 

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 40 | Continuity with wiki: Wiki says Elena is Lv 10 Analyst, Chapter says Lv 17 Senior Inspector. | Sync wiki to Chapter 38 (Lv 17). | PENDING SYNC |
| 106 | Logic: Alchemist Cartel controls ingredient supply. | Ensure future chapters reflect this supply chain bottleneck. | NOTE |
| 159 | Lore: Previous Restructurer 16 years ago. | Update `World/` lore or `Plot_Outline.md` to track this mystery. | PENDING SYNC |
| - | ARMI Formatting | Ensure non-transactional ARMI messages follow a consistent "Header + Data" structure. | FIXED (checked) |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The transition from "watching" to "sitting at the table" is a bit abrupt but fits Victor's lack of hesitation.
- Mentioning Zip's "many drawers" is a nice character beat that maintains the "inn" setting.
