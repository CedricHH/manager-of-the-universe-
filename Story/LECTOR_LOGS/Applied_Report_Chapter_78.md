## 1. Verdict: **PASS** (Score: 58/60)

| Criteria | Score | Observations |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Hook** | 10/10 | The surgical silence and ARMI 2.0 interface start the chapter with immediate focus. |
| **Pacing** | 9/10 | Alternates well between Victor's office and the despair at the front lines. |
| **Voice** | 10/10 | Victor's clinical detachment and "Supply Chain Strangling" feel authentic to his corporate roots. |
| **Cliffhanger** | 10/10 | Taking the Cathedral's land is a massive escalation. |
| **Style Guide** | 10/10 | Corporate jargon (margin, foreclosure, liquidation) is used effectively. |
| **Continuity** | 9/10 | Perfectly follows the insurance payout from Ch 77. |

## 2. Qualitative Analysis

### Strengths
- **The "Business as War" theme**: This is the strongest execution of the series' premise yet. Buying the Hub to control hero unemployment is brilliant.
- **Groll's Fall**: Seeing the antagonist realize he was played by a red ribbon is very satisfying.
- **Aurelia's realization**: The threat is no longer just a monster in a hole; it's a landlord.

### Minor Suggestions
- **Sniv's Role**: Sniv could have a bit more dialogue about how "clean" the takeover feels compared to goblin raids.
- **Elara's reaction**: A bit more of her moral internal conflict would be good—she knows this is "better" than war, but she sees the human cost of the bankrupted guilds.
