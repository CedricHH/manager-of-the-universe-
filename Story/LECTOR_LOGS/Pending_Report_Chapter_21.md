## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 13, 59, 95 | Character "Mira (Archer)" appears out of nowhere. | Replace with "Lysa (Cleric)" from party list. | PENDING |
| 59 | Gareth Level 14 (should be 12). | Change to Level 12. | PENDING |
| 59 | Bron Level 12 (should be 14). | Change to Level 14. | PENDING |
| 60 | Kaelie Level 12 (should be 13). | Change to Level 13. | PENDING |
| 59-60 | Role classification (Two DPS) is wrong if the 6th is a Cleric. | Reclassify roles: 1 Tank, 1 Off-tank, 1 DPS, 1 Healer, 1 Support, 1 Mage. | PENDING |
| 13 | "Armani suit" vs "Italian suit" (line 11). | Line 15 says "Armani", line 196 says "Italian". Standardize to "tailored Italian suit". | PENDING |

## Observations
- Victor's voice is exceptionally strong and consistent with the Style Guide.
- The use of [ARMI] messages is correct and enhances the "Corporate LitRPG" feel.
- The continuity from Chapter 20 is smooth, but the internal consistency of the "Silver Lance" party members needs strict alignment with `Characters/The_Silver_Lance.md`.
