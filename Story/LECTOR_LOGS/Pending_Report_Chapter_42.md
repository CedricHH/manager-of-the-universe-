## Overview
A critical turning point. The dialogue between Victor and Groll is masterful, highlighting their similar predatory natures while establishing Victor's superior adaptability. The blackmail regarding the dungeon is a major plot escalation that effectively ends the "Oakhaven Market" phase and begins the "War" phase.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 159 | Typo: "supressed" | Change to "suppressed". | PENDING FIX |
| 195 | Typo: "Victor sked." | Change to "Victor asked." | PENDING FIX |
| 169 | Logic Check: Kingdom Law vs. Dungeon Lords. | Good lore establishing the legal threat to the dungeon. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The "Liquidation protocol" (burning the building) is a dark humor highlight.
- Victor's refusal to be "bought" because the Guild is "obsolete" reinforces his corporate philosophy over pure greed.
