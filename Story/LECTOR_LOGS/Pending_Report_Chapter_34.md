## Observations
- **Delegation**: The formal handover of authority to Sniv/Asterion/Nova provides a clear structure for the "Home Front" while Victor is away.
- **Emotional Beat**: The scene with Sniv expressing gratitude ("Boss is... good Boss") adds a layer of genuine stakes to Victor's "investment" logic.
- **Cover Identity**: The "Potion Trader" identity with forged labels fits perfectly with Zip's character and Victor's background.
- **Continuity Check**: Goblin count (26) is consistent with Chapter 31's report.

## Final Verdict
Chapter is excellent and requires no fixes. Ready for sync.
