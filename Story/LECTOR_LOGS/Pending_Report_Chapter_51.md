# Lector Analysis: Chapter 51 - The Crown Asset

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 |
| Pacing | 10/10 |
| Voice | 10/10 |
| Cliffhanger | 10/10 |
| Word Count | 10/10 (1566 words) |

## Overview
A strong start to Act 1.3. The strategic shift from defense to "courting" the Crown Prince is well-executed. The tension between Victor's corporate optimism and Valerius's bureaucratic dread remains a highlight.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| - | **[CRITICAL] Naming Overload** | There are four characters with the name "Aldric" mentioned in this chapter: Prince Aldric, Inspector Aldric, Lord Aldric (Sterling), and King Aldric. | **FLAGGED FOR REVIEW** |
| 13 | Imagery: "Idealism was just naivety with better marketing." | Excellent Victor-voice quote. | OK |
| 153 | Pace: "Timeline Accelerated" | Good use of ARMI to communicate the mechanical shift in stakes. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- **Naming**: I strongly recommend changing the names of at least two of the "Aldrics" to avoid reader confusion. For example, Inspector Aldric Vorne could become "Inspector Silas Vorne".
- **Victor's History**: Note the "Accelerator" event where the timeline jumped from 18 days to 72 hours.
- **Prince Aldric's Profile**: Initiate if not existing.
