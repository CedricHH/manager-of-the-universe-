## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook | 10/10 | "Victor calculated the rate of decay..." perfect character voice. |
| Pacing | 10/10 | Action-oriented (slime farming) + Tension (rat encounter). |
| Voice | 10/10 | "Pest control through payroll." Classic Victor. |
| Cliffhanger | 9/10 | Deep dungeon threat ("something large shifted") hinted at. |
| Word Count | 10/10 | ~1,680 words (Target: 1,500-2,000). |
| **Overall** | **10/10** | **Flawless chapter.** |

## Consistencies & Logic
- **Math**: Collected 15 Jellies. Sniv ate 1. Rat ate 1. Remaining 13 matches the 13 hungry goblins. Perfect resource management.
- **Formatting**: Quotation marks are standard English (`"`), unlike previous chapters.
- **Lore**: Slime farming mechanics (infinite respawn) are clever and fit the LitRPG/Manager theme.
