# Lector Analysis: Chapter 33

## Quick Score

| Criterion | Score | Note |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Hook | 8/10 | Direct transition to the Archive study. |
| Pacing | 7/10 | Log-driven info-dump, but fits corporate theme. |
| Voice | 9/10 | Victor's cynical take on "martyrdom" is top-tier. |
| Cliffhanger | 8/10 | Strong setup for the Oakhaven arc. |
| Word Count | 10/10 | 1667 words (Target: 1500-2000). |

## Issues

| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 1-10 | Logic | Archive described as "dormant... waiting for authentication" at the desk, but it already spoke in the hallway in Ch 31/32 without authentication. | Add a line mentioning that the hallway voice was a "proximity-triggered greeting" or "teaser protocol." |
| 171 | Consistency | Waypoint in Oakhaven is listed as "3 days travel." In Ch 34/35, this might need to match. | Cross-check with Chapter 34 once verified. |
| 208-216| Continuity | Zip's presence: Make sure his transition from "Floor 3 labor" to "Victor's Office" is clear. | Minor: It's implied he followed Victor up. |
