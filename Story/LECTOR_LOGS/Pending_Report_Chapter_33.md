## Observations
- **Lore Integration**: The logs from Restructurer #1 are a very effective way to provide backstory without slowing down the immediate "business" of the chapter.
- **Victor's Pragmatism**: His rejection of R#1's "refusal strategy" in favor of "leverage" is a brilliant maturation of his character. He isn't a rebel; he's a takeover artist.
- **Managerial Growth**: Testing Sniv with operational authority while Victor travels to Oakhaven is a natural progression of the "Management Layer" narrative.
- **Cover Story**: Zip's idea for a "potion merchant" cover is a classic LitRPG trope used effectively here as a corporate facade.

## Final Verdict
Chapter is excellent and requires no fixes. Proceed to sync.
