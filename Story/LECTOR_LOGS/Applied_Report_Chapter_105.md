## Approved Changes

### Change 1: Fix Chinese Character Typo

**Location**: Line 134

**Original**:
```
His office overlooked Market Quarter—floor-to-ceiling windows showing the商業 landscape he'd controlled for thirty-eight years.
```

**Replacement**:
```
His office overlooked Market Quarter—floor-to-ceiling windows showing the commercial landscape he'd controlled for thirty-eight years.
```

**Reason**: Typo correction ("商業" = Chinese characters should be "commercial")

**Status**: APPROVED

---

### Change 2: Add Sensory Detail to Marcus Demonstration

**Location**: Lines 85-90 (Marcus's quality testing)

**Original**:
```
He pulled a sample vial, activated a mana-testing crystal. The potion glowed green—99.7% purity rating.
```

**Replacement**:
```
He pulled a sample vial, activated a mana-testing crystal. The potion glowed green radiating soft warmth. The crystal chimed—a pure, resonant tone indicating perfect mana stability. 99.7% purity rating.
```

**Reason**: Adds auditory sensory detail (chime) and tactile/visual (warmth, glow)

**Status**: APPROVED

---

## Optional Trims (For Word Count Reduction)

### Optional Trim: Inspection Sequence

**Location**: Lines 60-110 (Greymark inspection details)

**Current**: ~400 words
**Trim to**: ~320 words (remove 80 words)

**Suggestion**: Condense storage inspection from detailed paragraph to 2-3 sentences summary

**Status**: OPTIONAL (only if strict word count enforcement)

---

## Summary

Chapter 105 delivers excellent execution:
