## Overview
A strong follow-up to the market fire. Victor's "B2B" negotiation is a highlight, perfectly blending his corporate background with the fantasy setting. The confrontation with the thugs and the subsequent invitation to "The Spire" effectively escalates the conflict from street-level to institutional warfare.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 185 | Typo: "fire implies" | Change to "fire and fear" or "fire-bombs". Suggested: "fire and fear". | PENDING FIX |
| 131 | Consistency: "Zip, next customer." | Smooth transition. | OK |
| 235 | Lore: Groll's summoning. | Ensure "The Spire" is consistently described as the Alchemist HQ. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The "Platinum Supply Retainer" is a great piece of corporate jargon integrated as magic/contract law.
- Kael and Mira's performance as "Guild Personnel" adds significant institutional weight to Victor's operation.
