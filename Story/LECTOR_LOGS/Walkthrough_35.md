# Walkthrough: Pipe Lector Chapter 35

We have completed the quality analysis and synchronization for Chapter 35: "The Road".

## 🛠 Key Developments

- **First Surface Contacts**: Victor established contact with **Halric Voss**, a Merchant Guild Associate, identifying a potential wholesale market for slime extract.
- **Economic Intelligence**: Lord Sterling's extractive toll model (10 GP for merchants) was identified as a target for future disruption.
- **The Ambush**: Sterling's enforcers intercepted Victor for selling unregistered dungeon goods.
- **Strategic Pivot**: Instead of fighting, Victor leveraged a **Mana Crystal** and his **Consortium Documentation** (Black Card) to pivot the confrontation into a business meeting. He is now being escorted to Sterling Manor as a guest.

## 📂 Project Sync Status

| File | Updates Made |
|------|--------------|
| [Victor_Kaine.md](file:///Characters/Victor_Kaine.md) | Added history for Ch 35 (Toll bridge, meeting enforcers, leverage play). |

| [Lord_Sterling.md](file:///Characters/Lord_Sterling.md) | Verified existing Ch 35 history (Toll stations/enforcers). |

## 📊 Verification Results
- **Word Count**: 1759 words (Target: 1500-2000).
- **Consistency**: Math for GP (50 - 10 = 40) is correct. Skills usage and costs are consistent with `ARMI_System.md`.
- **Narrative**: Successfully shifts the tension from physical combat to corporate negotiation.
