# Lector Report: Chapter 62

## 1. Overview
- **Chapter**: 62 - The Compliance Officer
- **Word Count**: ~1,500 (Estimated)
- **Status**: [PENDING]

## 2. Qualitative Analysis
- **Hook**: "It felt like a prison visit." Strong opening establishing the mood shift.
- **Tone**: The shift from "Dungeon Fantasy" to "Dungeon Bureaucracy" is well executed. Victor spinning a Paladin death-threat into a "Safety Feature" is peak character voice.
- **Pacing**: Good daily slice-of-life feel with a strong pivot at the end (The Bank).
- **New Character**: Sir Roland is a great foil. Silent, threatening, immovable.

## 3. Issues & Fixes
| ID | Severity | Issue | Proposed Fix | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 01 | Minor | "Penance Special" discount feels a bit too easy/quick to implement. | Add Valerius frantically scribbling a "coupon" to make it feel improvised. | [APPROVED] |
| 02 | Major | The "Banker" appearance feels sudden. | Mention Valerius having sent financial reports out in previous chapters (maybe implicitly). No fix needed if we accept the bank watches "liquidity events". | [IGNORE] |

## 4. Implementation Plan
- **Fix 01**: Add Valerius making the coupons.

## 5. Sync Triggers
- **New Faction**: Gilded Ledger of Oakhaven (The Bank).
- **New Character**: Sir Roland (Paladin Watcher).
- **New NPC**: The unnamed Banker.
- **Status Change**: "High Rollers" (Necromancers/Assassins) are boycotting the dungeon.
