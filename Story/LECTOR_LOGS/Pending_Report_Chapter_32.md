## Observations
- **Lore Drop**: The "Restructurer #1" journal and the "Harvest" concept provide the overarching conflict for the series. It shifts the story from mere dungeon management to survival against cosmic predators.
- **Character Consistency**: Victor's reaction—focusing on ROI and cataloguing assets instead of having a breakdown—is perfectly in character.
- **Nova's Vulnerability**: The revelation that Nova has "gaps" in its memory due to Consortium maintenance adds a layer of irony and potential future conflict within the partnership.
- **The Card**: The "Priority Asset Transfer Notice" is a great hook for the next arc.

## Final Verdict
Chapter is excellent and requires no fixes. Proceed to sync.
