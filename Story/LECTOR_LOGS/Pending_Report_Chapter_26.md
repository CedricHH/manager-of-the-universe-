# Lector Analysis: Chapter 26 - Employee Orientation

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 |
| Pacing | 8/10 |
| Voice | 10/10 |
| Cliffhanger | 9/10 |
| Word Count | 4/10 (1127 words - TARGET: 1500+) |

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| - | Significant Word Count Deficit | The chapter needs expansion (approx. 400 words). Suggest expanding the orientation scene or adding a scene of Victor preparing the documents/chart. | PENDING |
| 111 | CEO / Administrator title | Consistent with Victor's progression. | NOTE |

## Observations
- **Math Check**: ARMI says 25 Goblins. Org chart shows 22 (Sniv + Krog + 5 Guard + 15 Workers). Adding the 3 Recon scouts from Ch 24 brings the total to 25. Continuity is PERFECT here.
- The "Dental Coverage" bit for Asterion is peak corporate satire.
- Zip's reaction to being "Chief" is very on-character.
- The transition to the Dungeon Core's "Awakening" sets up the next arc perfectly.

## Proposed Fix (Expansion)
- Add a scene where Victor discusses the concept of "executive benefits" with Sniv while preparing the contract.
- Expand the orientation scene with a few more specific "corporate" questions from Zip or reactions from the more "senior" worker goblins.
