## Summary

Chapter 3 successfully transitions from action (Ch 1-2) to reflection. The first flashback fragment is appropriately mysterious, Victor's character deepens through his compulsive organizing, and the food crisis creates a natural cliffhanger. The ARMI stats reveal is both informative and humorous.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to Sync - no revisions needed.
