## Summary

Chapter 2 excellently continues from Chapter 1's cliffhanger, introduces Sniv as a memorable first employee, and establishes the provisional goblin workforce. Victor's competence display (negotiating from weakness) is the highlight. Asterion foreshadowed appropriately.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to Phase 4 (Sync Content) - no revisions needed.
