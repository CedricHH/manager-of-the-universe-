# Lector Analysis: Chapter 09

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 | "The new goblins ate last." Establishes hierarchy immediately. |
| Pacing | 10/10 | Merit system → Guard-2 incident → Iron ore → Sir Kael discovery. Excellent flow. |
| Voice | 10/10 | "Primitive gamification. Effective for low-INT workforce." Classic ARMI. |
| Cliffhanger | 10/10 | Sir Kael's warning about Asterion. Stakes raised. |
| Word Count | 10/10 | ~1,720 words (Target: 1,500-2,000). |
| **Overall** | **9.8/10** | **Excellent worldbuilding chapter.** |

## Consistencies & Logic
- **Employee Count**: 26 (14+12). Consistent with Ch 7-8. ✓
- **Sniv Evolution**: 18%. Matches Ch 8 Memory Recovery (same number—is this intentional or error?). 
- **Floor Layout**: Operations on Floors 2-3, Command on Floor 1. Wait—ARMI says "Floor 5 (Command)". ERROR.
- **Scroll Says**: Party: "Marcus, Elena, Sven, Kael". But Marcus was the dead hero from Ch 1. POTENTIAL REFERENCE.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 226 | ARMI says "Floor 5 (Command)" but text says Floor 1 is Command (Line 141). Boss Chamber is on Floor 1 (near dungeon entrance). | Change "Floor 5 (Command)" to "Floor 1 (Command)" | FIXED |
| 191 | "Marcus fell first." - This matches the dead hero from Ch 1! Likely **intentional lore connection** (same Marcus). | No fix needed—Easter egg preserved. | OK |
