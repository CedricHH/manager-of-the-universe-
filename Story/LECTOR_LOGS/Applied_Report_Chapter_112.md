**None.** This chapter is a standout example of the project's style.

## Summary

Chapter 112 successfully transitions the story to the new setting (Terra-Solvaris). The shift from Oakhaven's control to Solvaris's chaos is visceral. Victor's adaptation—treating war negotiation like a business deal—forms a strong core theme. The immediate transition to the siege provides excellent momentum for Ch 113.

**Verdict**: ✅ **PASS**

## APPROVED Changes

**None required.**

## Next Chapter Recommendations

**Chapter 113 (The Siege Protocol)** should:
1. Deliver on the "Fight or die" promise immediately.
2. Showcase Resh's Tier 4 combat abilities (distinguishing him from Oakhaven threats).
3. Show Victor managing the "economics of battle" (resource allocation) as promised.
