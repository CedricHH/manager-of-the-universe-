# Lector Analysis: Chapter 07

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 | Map description is evocative but slower than Ch 6. |
| Pacing | 10/10 | Perfect action sequence: planning → diversion → strike → aftermath. |
| Voice | 10/10 | "Sniv is HR." Chef's kiss. |
| Cliffhanger | 8/10 | Onboarding is next—solid but less urgent than combat cliffhanger. |
| Word Count | 10/10 | ~1,750 words (Target: 1,500-2,000). |
| **Overall** | **9.4/10** | **Strong action chapter.** |

## Consistencies & Logic
- **Combat Math**: 4 eliminated + 19 routed = 23 hostiles. Matches Line 73 count. ✓
- **Acquisitions**: 12 new + 14 veteran = 26 total. ✓
- **Acid Sacs**: Started with 3, used 1, 2 remaining. ✓

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 9 | Continuity: "Guard Team—four goblins" but Ch 6 established Guard Team as **3** goblins (1 Lead + 2 workers). | Change "four goblins" to "three goblins" | FIXED |
| 19 | Math: "Five goblins total, including himself." Victor + Sniv + 3 guards = 5. But if Guard is 3, he can only take 2 guards + Sniv = 4 with him. OR he took someone from another team. | Clarify by changing "Five goblins total" to "Five bodies total—Victor, Sniv, three guards, and one volunteer from Food Team" | FIXED |
| 51 | Reference: "Fourteen versus twenty-eight." But Ch 6 ended with 14 goblins; this battle is 5 vs 23. The "14 vs 28" refers to overall totals, not this strike force. | Consider clarifying this is total workforce comparison, not strike force. Minor. | Optional |
