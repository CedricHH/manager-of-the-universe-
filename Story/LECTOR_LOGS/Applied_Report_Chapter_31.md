## Strengths

### 1. **Corporate Voice Mastery**
The chapter perfectly captures Victor's analytical mindset:
- "We're a business, not a fortress."
- "I'm giving them *scheduled maintenance*."
- "A goblin at sixty percent efficiency because he's exhausted is worse than a goblin at full capacity five days out of six."

### 2. **Character Development**
The morale subplot deepens Victor's character:
- He recognizes the exploitative structure he once created
- Makes a "kind" decision but frames it as logistics
- Brief moment of self-reflection: "Would the man who died in the rain recognize him?"

### 3. **System Integration**
ARMI messages are perfectly formatted and enhance rather than interrupt narrative flow.

### 4. **Cliffhanger Execution**
The ancient voice is mysterious, competent-sounding, and creates immediate intrigue for Chapter 32.

### 5. **Pacing**
Three clear acts:
1. Infrastructure decisions (economic competence)
2. Employee morale (character depth)
3. Mysterious discovery (plot hook)

## Final Assessment

**Chapter 31 is publication-ready.**

This chapter successfully:
1. Advances the dungeon's economic development
2. Deepens Victor's character through the morale subplot
3. Introduces a major plot hook (ancient sealed chamber)
4. Maintains perfect consistency with established lore
5. Demonstrates Victor's competence in multiple domains

The morale scene is particularly strong—it shows Victor's growth without betraying his core personality. He's still calculating and pragmatic, but the recognition of his past exploitation adds depth.

The cliffhanger is excellent. The ancient voice suggests:
- A being older than the dungeon
- Someone who values competence
- Potential ally, enemy, or wild card

**No revisions required.**
