## Issues

| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 26 | "EARTH. SIX MONTHS AFTER PROJECT COBALT." — Bold timestamp works but could use consistent formatting | Consider using blockquote or italics for flashback headers | SKIPPED (style choice, works well) |
| 137 | "PRESENT DAY — TERRA-INSOLVIA" — same formatting note | Keep consistent with line 26 | ✅ Already consistent |
| N/A | No major issues detected | — | — |

## Strengths

1. **Emotional Depth Without Sentimentality**: Victor frames his moral awakening as mathematics ("200 lives versus one"), maintaining his analytical voice while revealing profound humanity
2. **Backstory Integration**: The flashback is triggered organically (preparing for Crown Prince = high-stakes risk = memory of last high-stakes risk)
3. **Project Cobalt Details**: Specific, believable corporate scandal — conflict minerals, children, poisoned river, government cover-up
4. **Sniv's Moment**: "Sniv always listening. Sniv is HR. Listening is job." — Perfect character beat that lightens the heavy material
5. **ARMI Commentary**: "The one that *didn't* calculate" — System acknowledging the anomaly that got Victor selected

| **52** | ✅ WRITTEN | The Decision (server room begins) |

| 55 | PENDING | The Death (assassination, wake in dungeon) |

## Summary

Excellent chapter that delivers crucial backstory while maintaining narrative momentum. Victor's "selfless act" is framed precisely as the style guide requires — not heroic moralizing, but cold calculation that happens to align with morality. The dual timeline structure (present/flashback) works seamlessly. Sniv's HR surveillance reveal provides necessary levity after heavy material.

**Recommendation**: No changes required. Proceed to Chapter 53.
