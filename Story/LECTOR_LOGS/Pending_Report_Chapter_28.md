## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| - | Word Count Deficit | The chapter needs expansion (approx. 400 words). Suggest expanding the flashback scene with more psychological weight or adding a scene showing Krog's team preparations. | PENDING |

## Observations
- **Flashback Entry**: Connecting the mage Mira's intelligence to Victor's past inquiry ("Where did the numbers come from?") is excellent character work.
- **Tone Consistency**: Victor's cold analysis of the "Iron Wolves" contrasted with his emerging protective instinct for the young analyst-type (Tessa) adds depth.
- **Continuity**: The "Dental Section" callback for Asterion is a nice touch.

## Proposed Fix (Expansion)
- Expand the flashback to include more of the silence and isolation Victor felt after the scandal—the physical sensation of his life dissolving.
- Deepen the scene of Krog and the guard team's briefing from Victor—show Victor's hands-on management style during the ETA countdown.
- Elaborate on the "Iron Wolves" initial movements in the dungeon—show, don't just tell, Mira's caution.
