# Lector Report: Chapter 60

## 1. Overview
- **Chapter**: 60 - The VIP Experience
- **Word Count**: ~1,500 (Estimated)
- **Status**: [PENDING]

## 2. Qualitative Analysis
- **Hook**: Strong opening. Aurelia's immediate antagonism sets the stakes.
- **Pacing**: Fast. The sequence of "Tour -> Demo -> Deal -> Cliffhanger" flows well.
- **Character Voice**:
    - **Victor**: Corporate/Sarcastic voice is consistent ("Monetize demand").
    - **Aldric**: Bored but greedy. The "Fiscal Crisis" reveal adds depth.
    - **Aurelia**: Fanatical but not stupid. She is a credible threat.
- **Mechanics**: The "Disco Protocol" is a creative use of existing assets (slimes) to counter a high-level threat without revealing true power. Fits the "Manager" archetype.

## 3. Issues & Fixes
| ID | Severity | Issue | Proposed Fix | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| 01 | Minor | Sniv's dialogue might be too relaxed for a Royal presence. | Ensure Sniv is terrified appropriately. | [APPROVED] |
| 02 | Minor | The "Fiscal Crisis" reveal might need more setup in earlier chapters (hinted at in Ch 51). | No fix needed here, consistent with established intel. | [IGNORE] |

## 4. Implementation Plan
- **Fix 01**: Check Sniv's curtsy scene. He says "Please do not kill us!", which fits. Maybe add a physical reaction like "trembling".

## 5. Sync Triggers
- **New Relationship**: Prince Aldric (Business Partner / Leaseholder).
- **New Threat**: High Priestess Aurelia (Active Scanner).
- **New Item**: "Disco Protocol" (Prismatic Slime tactic).
- **World Lore**: Kingdom of Valdris is broke (Fiscal Crisis confirmed).
