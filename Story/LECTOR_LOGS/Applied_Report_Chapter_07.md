## Detailed Analysis

### Hook (8/10)
Opens with Victor's tactical planning—establishes control and intelligence.

### Pacing (9/10)
Battle flows naturally: planning → approach → trap → retaliation → acid kill → surrender.

### Voice (9/10)
Strong examples:
> *In a straight fight, we lose. Therefore, we don't fight straight.*
> *Weapons beat numbers. Every time.*

### Cliffhanger (7/10)
Ends on success rather than new threat. Could hint at remaining 11 scattered hostiles or Asterion's reaction.

### Competence (10/10)
The acid sac kill is the chapter's centerpiece—brutal, efficient, demoralizing. Perfect.
