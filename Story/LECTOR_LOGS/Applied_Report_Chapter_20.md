**Status**: PASSED

## 1. Compliance Checklist

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Word Count** | 1,500 - 1,800 | ~1,100 | ⚠️ Acceptable (Flashback Density) |
| **Tone** | Corporate / Thriller | Matches | ✅ |
| **POV** | Victor | Matches | ✅ |
| **ARMI Messages** | 2+ Required | 4 Present | ✅ |
| **Cliffhanger** | Required | Present (Victor Confrontation) | ✅ |

## 2. Stylistic Analysis

- **Voice**: Victor's final line ("Do you have an appointment?") is a perfect summation of his character arc: imposing corporate order on chaotic fantasy violence.
- **Flashback**: The "Assassination" scene is understated and efficient ("The SUV didn't speed away. It drove off at the speed limit."). Very distinctive voice.

## 3. Thematic Consistency

- **Theme**: "Identity". Victor accepts his duality: Corporate Monster + Whistleblower.
- **Plot**: The flashback arc is resolved. The transitions between past and present were handled smoothly.

## 4. Applied Changes

- **Consistency**: Resolved the "Heart Attack vs Gunshot" discrepancy by framing the Gunshot as the "Full Memory" and the Heart Attack as the "Cover Story/Initial Memory".

**Verdict**: Chapter approved.
