## Observations
- **Worldbuilding**: Road quality and bridge tolls effectively characterize the region's decaying infrastructure and extractive governance.
- **Character Consistency**: Victor's immediate analysis of Lord Sterling's "business model" is perfectly on-brand. Not a hero, but a competitor identifying a weak incumbent.
- **Inventory/Math**: Victor starts with 50 GP, pays 10 GP toll, and correctly tracks 40 GP remaining. Correct use of the high-level Mana Crystal for leverage.
- **Narrative Stakes**: Shifting the conflict from physical combat (which Victor would lose) to a high-level business negotiation is a strong way to leverage his strengths in a new environment.

## Final Verdict
Chapter is excellent and requires no fixes. Proceed to sync.
