# Lector Analysis: Chapter 50 - The Audit

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score |

| Cliffhanger | 10/10 |

## Overview
A brilliant conclusion to the "First Audit" arc. Victor's "Weaponized Transparency" is a perfect extension of his corporate background. The transition from bureaucratic defense to offensive lobbying (Targeting the Crown) provides a perfect hook for the next arc.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 28/179 | Naming: "Aldric" overload | We have Inspector Aldric Vorne, Lord Aldric Sterling, and Crown Prince Aldric. This is confusing. | FLAG FOR USER |
| 133 | Logic: "Heating system" | Humorous and effective way to mask Nova's sapience. | OK |
| 190 | Quote: "Kings are just customers..." | Excellent final line that summarizes Victor's worldview. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- Update Victor's history: Successfully survived the Guild Audit.
- Note the naming redundancy of "Aldric" for the user.
- Mark Arc 1.2 as Complete.
