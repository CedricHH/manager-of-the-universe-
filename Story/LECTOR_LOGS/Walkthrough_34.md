# Walkthrough: Pipe Lector Chapter 34

We have completed the quality analysis and synchronization for Chapter 34: "Preparations".

## 🛠 Key Developments

- **Delegation of Authority**: Victor formally handed over operational control of the dungeon for one week.
    - **Sniv (COO)**: Operational Authority & Management Test.
    - **Asterion (CSO)**: Security Authority.
    - **Nova**: Monitoring & Payment Protocols.
- **The Oakhaven Mission**: Victor and Zip have departed for Oakhaven disguised as potion merchants to claim Victor's Rank 2 upgrade and gather intelligence on the Consortium.
- **Security Check**: Autonomous payment protocols have been set for the scheduled return of the Iron Wolves in four days.

## 📂 Project Sync Status

| File | Updates Made |
|------|--------------|
| [Victor_Kaine.md](file:///Characters/Victor_Kaine.md) | Added history for Ch 34 (Delegation, departure for Oakhaven). |
| [Sniv.md](file:///Characters/Sniv.md) | Update with "Operational Authority" and his loyalty beat. |
| [Zip.md](file:///Characters/Zip.md) | Recorded his role as the Oakhaven companion and the "no stealing" clause. |
| [Dungeon_Core.md](file:///Dungeon_Core.md) | Updated with risk analysis and autonomous protocols. |
| [Asterion.md](file:///Characters/Asterion.md) | Update with "Security Authority" for the week. |
| [Iron_Wolves.md](file:///Characters/Iron_Wolves.md) | Added history for Ch 29-30 and the scheduled Ch 34 return. |

## 📊 Verification Results
- **Word Count**: 1842 words (Target: 1500-2000).
- **Consistency**: The delegation of authority is consistent with Victor's managerial background and sets up the stakes for the "Home Front" in future chapters.
- **Voice**: Victor's "Performance-based severance" threat to Zip and "Investment" logic with Sniv are perfectly in character.
