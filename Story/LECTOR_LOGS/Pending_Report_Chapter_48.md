# Lector Analysis: Chapter 48 - The Whale

## Quick Score
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Hook | 9/10 |

| Voice | 10/10 |
| Cliffhanger | 10/10 |
| Word Count | 10/10 (1700 words) |

## Overview
A high-stakes negotiation chapter that successfully humbles a noble and sets the stage for a massive vertical integration play. The contrast between Victor's boardroom tactics and Gareth's traditional pride is handled perfectly.

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 40 | Consistency: "Lord Reginald Sterling" | Check if it should be "Lord Aldric Sterling III" based on wiki. | PENDING FIX |
| 131 | Logic: "Five gold" upgrade fee | Fits the "whale" strategy perfectly. | OK |
| 187 | Economics: "10,000 gold annual revenue" | Plausible for a regional monopoly, though small compared to the 1M goal of the arc finale. | OK |

## Refinement Suggestions
- Update Gareth's profile: He is now an "envoy" and "paying customer" (humiliated).
- Sync Lord Sterling's profile: He is testing Victor via Gareth.
- Ensure the name "Reginald" is handled correctly across all chapters.
