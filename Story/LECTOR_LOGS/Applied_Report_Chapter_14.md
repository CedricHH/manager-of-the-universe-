# LECTOR REPORT: Chapter 14 - Customer Service

**SCORE**: 9.2/10
**VERDICT**: PASS

## CRITERIA ANALYSIS

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Hook** | 9/10 | Immediate immersion into the adventurers' perspective, quickly establishing their naivety and the stakes. The "Silver Lance" name drop is a strong hook for future plotlines. |
| **Pacing** | 9/10 | Excellent structure. The "Rehearsal" -> "Performance" -> "Review" rhythm works perfectly for the "Dungeon as Business" theme. The scare sequence has good tension without dragging. |
| **Voice** | 10/10 | Victor's corporate cynicism is peak here. "Customer Service," "Special Effects Team," "Marketing Department" - the metaphors are consistent and funny. Sniv's loyalty and "stick" role are well defined. |
| **Cliffhanger** | 9/10 | The deadline is effectively restated. "Tomorrow... or we become lunch." The stakes are clear and high. |
| **Word Count** | PASS | ~1,988 words. Slightly over target (1,500-1,800), but the density of content (action + dialogue + intel) justifies it. No fluff detected. |
| **Competence** | 10/10 | Victor executes a complex plan perfectly. He manipulates the adventurers not just into leaving, but into working for him (marketing). This is a prime example of "Intellectual Protagonist." |

## HIGHLIGHTS

*   **The Rehearsal**: Seeing the "behind the scenes" of the dungeon (goblins practicing screams, Victor checking lighting) is hilarious and unique to this genre.
*   **The "Scare"**: The non-lethal raid is written with enough tension that we fear for the adventurers, even though we know Victor's intent. The "String of Torment" and "Combat Roll" were great additions.
*   **The Loot Analysis**: Victor deducing the "Silver Lance" connection from a diary entry is a great way to deliver exposition naturally.
*   **The Metaphor**: The entire chapter reinforces the "Dungeon Manager" theme—treating adventurers as customers/marketing tools rather than just enemies.

## ISSUES / NOTES

*   **Minor Note**: The word count is on the higher side, but acceptable given the expansion of the action sequence.

## RECOMMENDATION

**PUBLISH IMMEDIATELY.** This chapter serves as a perfect transition from the "Setup" phase to the "First Major Conflict" phase (The Deadline). It establishes the dungeon's operational style perfectly.
