## Overview
A pivotal chapter that executes the "Corporate Warfare" theme perfectly. The juxtaposition of market pricing analysis with magical potions is sharp and entertaining. The sabotage ending is predictable but well-used for "legal ammunition."

## Issues
| Line | Problem | Fix | Status |
|------|---------|-----|--------|
| 221 | Typo: "aresubstantiated" | Change to "are substantiated". | FIXED |
| 7 | Formatting: ARMI Market Analysis | Ensure formatting matches `STYLE_GUIDE.md` for consistent headers. | FIXED (checked) |

## Refinement Suggestions
- The "magic telephone" analogy by Zip is a good touch to bridge the gap between fantasy and corporate jargon.
- The cost breakdown at lines 69-71 is very effective for worldbuilding.
