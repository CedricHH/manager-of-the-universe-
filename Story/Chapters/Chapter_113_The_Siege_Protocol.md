# Chapter 113 - The Siege Protocol

Artillery hit the northern barrier.

Victor's equilibrium screamed as the impact transferred through stone—shockwave reverberating through boots, teeth, skull. ARMI flashed damage assessment: **Barrier Integrity: 73%. Time to critical failure: 2 minutes 17 seconds.**

This wasn't Oakhaven. In Oakhaven, negotiations happened in rooms. Words were weapons. Contracts were ammunition.

Here, ammunition was *ammunition*—and it was currently reducing Ironhold's defenses to expensive rubble.

> **[ARMI: COMBAT ANALYTICS ACTIVATED]**
> Mode: Resource Assessment (Battle Operations)
> Hostile Force: 812 infantry, 42 combat mages
> Defensive Assets: 180 soldiers, 40 mages, declining structural integrity
> Status: CRITICAL

Resh moved before Victor finished processing. The draconic combat specialist vaulted over the command balcony railing—three-story drop, landed in a combat roll, kept moving. Twin blades appeared in his hands.

"Resh!" Sera shouted. "Northern breach, Sector 7!"

"Saw it." Resh's voice came through ARMI link, calm as quarterly projection. "Engaging."

Victor watched through ARMI's tactical overlay as Resh's icon raced toward the failing section. Forty Revolutionary soldiers had already breached the gap—Warlord defenders pulling back, formation collapsing.

*In Oakhaven, I managed inventory. Here, the inventory shoots back.*

Same math. Higher stakes.

---

General Dravik's command station operated like a war room merged with trading floor. Holographic displays showed real-time battle data—unit positions, ammunition counts, barrier strength. Officers shouted updates. Messengers ran coordinates.

Victor processed it all.

"Your mage rotation is inefficient," he said.

Dravik turned. Eyebrow raised. "Excuse me?"

"Forty combat mages. Fifteen active at any time. Twenty-five recovering." Victor pointed at the display. "Standard 60-40 rotation conserves mana for prolonged engagement. But Revolutionaries aren't planning prolonged—they're planning *overwhelming*. One massive push to crack your walls before you can reinforce."

"And your recommendation?"

"Collapse rotation to 70-30. All mages deploy simultaneously in coordinated bursts. Four-minute intervals. Maximum output, maximum terror. They're expecting steady fire—give them tidal waves."

Dravik's jaw tightened. Pride warring with practicality.

Artillery struck again. Display flickered. **Barrier Integrity: 61%.**

"Do it," Dravik ordered.

Officers scrambled to relay. Victor watched the hologram update—mage icons shifting positions, grouping at critical points. The next Revolutionary assault wave hit the wall.

And stopped.

Forty mages firing simultaneously turned the air into concentrated death. Revolutionary infantry shields—designed to deflect sustained fire—shattered under the focused barrage. Attackers fell back in disarray.

*Mage output increased 40%. Casualties reduced 15%.*

Dravik stared at the display. Then at Victor. "You've done this before."

"I've managed resource allocation in hostile environments." Victor didn't look away from the hologram. "The resources were usually employees. The hostility was usually competitors. But the math translates."

Another assault wave forming. More sophisticated this time—heavy shields at front, mages in support positions. Learning.

"They're adapting," Sera reported through tactical link. "Tribune Vex is coordinating personally. Level 17 Battle Mage. His barrier technique counters our concentrated fire."

Victor processed. Counter-strategy required.

---

Resh reached the northern breach as Victor calculated.

The combat specialist didn't fight like soldiers. He didn't block, parry, counter. He *moved*—fluid, inevitable, a corporate restructuring made flesh. Revolutionary infantry who engaged him found their attacks deflecting off invisible force, their own momentum weaponized against them.

Anti-magic aura. Ten-meter radius. Mages couldn't target him. Couldn't even *perceive* him clearly through magical senses.

A Revolutionary Captain—Level 14, decorated, scarred—stepped forward. "CONSORTIUM DOG! FACE ME!"

Challenge protocol. Honor combat. Victor recognized the tactic from Oakhaven nobles—formalized violence with rules. Resh recognized it too.

He closed the distance in two steps.

Twelve seconds. No weapons drawn. Pure martial efficiency. The Captain's enchanted armor didn't help—Resh struck joints, nerve clusters, pressure points. The final blow was a precise strike to the temple that dropped the Captain unconscious.

Resh took the insignia from the fallen officer's shoulder. Proof of claim.

"Breach stabilized," he reported. "Twenty-three hostile casualties. Remaining force retreating. Reinforcements?"

Victor checked displays. Eastern wall showing stress—but holding. Southern approach clear. Western gate secure.

"Pull reserves from Section 12. Eastern wall is feint. They want you stretched."

"Confirmed." Resh moved to consolidate.

> **[ARMI: COMBAT ANALYTICS]**
> Hostile Asset Value: 47,000 GP (combined force)
> Current Depreciation Rate: 340 GP/minute
> Status: ACCELERATING
> Note: Hostile force exhibiting suboptimal resource allocation. Recommend sustained pressure.

Victor almost smiled. Even ARMI treated warfare as financial analysis.

Tribune Cassian Vex appeared in the holographic display—real-time scrying feed from Sera's surveillance network.

Level 17. Battle Mage classification. Forty-three years old, former Revolutionary Army general staff, defected during the coup eighteen months ago. Personal kill count: classified. Reputation: *"The Peoples' Hammer."*

He stood behind the assault lines directing traffic. Barrier shimmering around him—personal protection that turned projectiles and deflected magic. More importantly, his commands spread through the Revolutionary force like network signals—coordinating, adapting, correcting.

"He's their command structure," Victor said. "Remove him, the assault collapses."

Dravik nodded slowly. "We've tried. His barrier has deflected every assassination attempt. Level 17 Battle Mage protection isn't theoretical—it's *absolute*."

"Nothing is absolute." Victor turned to Sera's feed. "What's the vulnerability?"

Sera's voice came through link: "Barrier requires concentration. Continuous, focused attention. It fails if he loses focus for more than 3 seconds."

"How do we break focus?"

"Overwhelming stimulus. Coordinated, precisely timed. He can handle multiple threats—but if they hit *simultaneously* from unexpected vectors..."

Victor processed. Artillery timing. Dravik's honor guard. Resh's positioning.

"General." Victor approached the holographic table. "I need three things: Your artillery batteries coordinated on a single target, your honor guard ready for a flanking assault, and exactly four minutes of your trust."

Dravik studied him. Calculating. The same look Victor had given to countless executives before restructuring their companies.

"You understand," Dravik said carefully, "that if this fails, I will personally execute you."

"Understood."

"And if it succeeds?"

"Then we negotiate your coalition proposal. As equals."

Silence. Artillery thundered outside. Revolutionary chanting audible—*"For the people! For the people!"*—mechanical, rhythmic, designed to intimidate.

"Four minutes," Dravik said. "Don't waste them."

---

The synchronized assault required precision Victor usually applied to contract clauses.

Step One: Artillery recalibration. All batteries targeting Vex's command position—not to hit him (impossible), but to create sensory chaos. Coordinated volley in three... two...

**IMPACT.**

Vex's barrier held. But his attention shifted—fractional compensation for the concentrated fire.

Step Two: Resh. Already in position, moving through the gap between Revolutionary lines. Anti-magic aura creating blind spot in their detection. Twenty meters from Vex. Fifteen. Ten.

Vex noticed. Barrier flickered as attention divided—artillery from above, infiltrator from behind.

*Not enough. Need third vector.*

Step Three: Dravik's honor guard. Twenty veterans, Level 15+, launched from hidden sally port on the fortress's eastern face. Cavalry charge into Revolutionary flank.

Three simultaneous threats. Artillery bombardment. Elite infiltrator. Cavalry assault.

For four seconds, Tribune Cassian Vex couldn't decide which one to prioritize.

His barrier flickered.

Resh struck.

The combat specialist didn't go for the kill—Victor had advised against it. Dead Tribune created martyr. Wounded Tribune created chaos. Resh's blade caught Vex across the shoulder, drew blood, forced a retreat response.

The Peoples' Hammer stumbled. Barrier collapsed entirely for two heartbeats. Revolutionary officers saw their commander *vulnerable* for the first time.

Panic spread like market crash.

Vex shouted—rallying cry, defiant—but the moment was broken. Revolutionary assault wave fragmented. Units retreating without orders. Mages teleporting away from the collapsing offensive.

Dravik's voice boomed across the battlefield: "CAVALRY ADVANCE! PUSH THEM BACK!"

Warlord forces—emboldened, focused—surged forward. The breach reversed. Revolutionary retreat became rout.

---

Dawn light painted Ironhold's walls gold.

Victor stood on the damaged northern battlement surveying the aftermath. Fires smoldered in Revolutionary camp. Body recovery crews working both sides of the field—temporary ceasefire for the dead.

> **[ARMI: BATTLE REPORT]**
> Ironhold Status: DEFENDED
> Revolutionary Casualties: 412 (estimated)
> Warlord Casualties: 47 dead, 123 wounded
> Victor's Contribution: Tactical Advisor (verified)
> Dravik Loyalty Shift: +23 points
> Note: "Soldier's respect" earned. Negotiation leverage increased.

Footsteps behind. Dravik approached without his usual guard escort. Different bearing now—not interrogator, not captor. Something closer to peer.

"Consortium advisors don't fight," Dravik said. "The previous teams observed from safe distance. You were in the command station calling strikes."

"I can't fight." Victor kept his eyes on the retreating Revolutionary forces. "But I can manage a battle. Same skill set, different context."

"You managed it well." Dravik stood beside him. "Perhaps your coalition proposal deserves consideration. But first—you need to understand what we're actually fighting for."

"Sixteen-point-seven million gold."

"No." Dravik's voice dropped. "The Bank isn't just gold. It's *leverage*. Everyone wants it because controlling Terra-Solvaris's financial system means controlling the reconstruction. Whoever holds the Bank writes the post-war order."

Victor processed. "And there are those beyond the five factions who want that power."

"You're quick." Dravik nodded. "There are... external interests. Off-world. Consortium isn't the only power watching this planet."

Before Victor could respond, magical energy crackled. Holographic projection materialized—Tribune Cassian Vex's face, wounded but furious, broadcasting from Revolutionary lines.

"GENERAL DRAVIK." Vex's voice carried across the battlefield. "You defended your stolen gold today. Enjoy the victory. Tomorrow, you face the full Revolutionary Army—not a probing force, but the HAMMER." His eyes found Victor in the projection. "And the Consortium vulture who helped you. Both of you. 72 hours. Surrender the Bank—or we burn Ironhold to ash and build the People's Republic on your graves."

Projection dissolved.

Silence.

Dravik exhaled slowly. "They're mobilizing everything. Full Revolutionary Army is thirty thousand troops."

"Then we have 72 hours to build a coalition that makes attacking unprofitable."

"You're insane."

"I'm a Restructurer." Victor turned from the wall. "Give me access to your communications network. I have some calls to make."

> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 2]**
> **[IRONHOLD: DAMAGED BUT OPERATIONAL]**
> **[REVOLUTIONARY ULTIMATUM: 72 HOURS]**
> **[MISSION CLOCK: 118 DAYS, 19 HOURS REMAINING]**
