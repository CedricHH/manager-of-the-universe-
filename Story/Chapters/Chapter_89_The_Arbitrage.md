# Chapter 89: The Arbitrage

The Gilded Caravan smelled like old magic and questionable decisions.

Victor Kaine sat at the desk—real mahogany, stolen or "salvaged" depending on which version of Barnaby's story you believed—and stared at the hologram floating above the obsidian card.

The Galactic Exchange.

It wasn't a marketplace. It was a feeding frenzy disguised as commerce.

The scrolling ticker displayed prices that would make a Wall Street trader weep:

- **Prayer Futures (Zeus-Sector)**: 4,200,000,000 Faith Points
- **Soul Fragments (Pure, Grade A)**: 18 Planetary Cores
- **Mana Well (Depleted)**: "Submit Offer"

Victor tapped his pen against the notebook. "Barnaby!"

"Yes, Boss?" The wagon driver's voice echoed from the front cabin, muffled by the dimensional fold between them.

"What's the market rate for a guaranteed rain blessing in the southern provinces?"

There was a pause. The sound of reins snapping. Then: "You mean like the Church sells? Fifty thousand gold, bare minimum. Last drought, they charged noble houses a hundred and twenty thousand—each! Private rain, guaranteed delivery. Why, Boss? You converting to the clergy? Want me to find you a fancy hat?"

"No." Victor's eyes tracked another listing. "I'm planning to become their competitor."

He scrolled past the billion-gold offers—the kind of numbers that required planetary taxation to afford—and filtered by currency: **Gold Pieces (GP) Only**.

The list shrank. Dramatically.

Most entities on the Exchange didn't trade in something as pedestrian as gold. They dealt in faith, souls, mana cores, or nebulous concepts like "Sworn Oaths" and "Future Favors."

But there were always desperate sellers.

Victor found one.

> **Listing #901-Gamma**
> **Seller:** Entity 'The Broken King' (World 44-Z)
> **Item:** [Blessing: Fertile Soil] (Tier 3 Divine Scroll)
> **Price:** 2,500 GP
> **Note:** "Army needs supplies. Harvest failed. Selling temple reserves."

Victor leaned back. 2,500 GP for a divine blessing that the Temple of Seasons charged 75,000 GP for on Terra-Insolvia.

ROI: 2,900%.

"Interesting."

He clicked the listing. A chat window materialized, glowing faintly green.

> **[USER_7749]:** Interested in Listing #901-Gamma. Is the blessing verified?

The reply came thirty seconds later. Fast, for an inter-dimensional message.

> **[BROKEN_KING_44]:** Yes. Court mage authenticated it. Need gold NOW. Enemy at gates. Will you buy or waste my time?

Victor smiled. Desperation was the most honest negotiating position.

> **[USER_7749]:** I'll buy. But I need delivery confirmation. How do I verify the blessing works before payment releases?

> **[BROKEN_KING_44]:** You think I scam? I am KING. My word is law.

> **[USER_7749]:** Your word isn't enforceable across dimensional barriers. I need an escrow system.

There was a longer pause this time. Victor imagined a warlord somewhere, staring at a glowing screen, surrounded by the sounds of siege engines and famine.

> **[BROKEN_KING_44]:** What is "escrow"?

Victor's fingers moved across the interface. He'd spent the last twenty minutes exploring the Exchange's features. Most were locked behind reputation tiers, but there was one option available to all users: **[Mana Lock Contract]**.

It was a basic smart contract. Payment held in dimensional stasis until both parties confirmed delivery.

He drafted the terms:

```
TERMS:
1. BROKEN_KING_44 uploads [Blessing: Fertile Soil] to Dimensional Vault.
2. USER_7749 deposits 2,500 GP into Mana Lock.
3. USER_7749 retrieves item at nearest Waypoint and confirms authenticity.
4. Upon confirmation, payment releases automatically.
5. If item is fraudulent, payment refunds to USER_7749.
```

He sent it.

Another pause. Then:

> **[BROKEN_KING_44]:** …Fine. Uploading now. Your system better not steal from me.

A progress bar appeared. 15%. 38%. 74%. 100%.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Transaction Status:** [Pending Confirmation]
> **Item Uploaded:** [Blessing: Fertile Soil] (Tier 3 Divine Scroll)
> **Vault Location:** Node 47-Sigma (Nearest Retrieval: Oakhaven Waypoint)
> **Escrow Amount:** 2,500 GP

Victor authorized the payment.

The numbers on his internal ledger shifted.

**Balance: 61,730 GP.**

He stared at the confirmation screen. The blessing was real. Authenticated by the Exchange's built-in verification runes. He'd just purchased a miracle for the price of a used carriage.

"I bought weather," Victor murmured. "From a king I'll never meet. On a world I'll never see."

It was the most corporate thing he'd ever done, and he'd once sold a factory's workforce to a shell company that didn't exist.

Outside, the wagon hit a bump. Barnaby cursed.

Victor ignored it. He was already scanning the next listings.

***

The problem revealed itself fifteen minutes later.

Victor had found six more underpriced items:

- [Ward: Plague Protection] (8,000 GP)
- [Miracle: Calm Seas] (3,200 GP)
- [Divine Favor: Harvest Abundance] (6,500 GP)

All from desperate sellers. All priced at 5-10% of their Terra-Insolvia market value.

He clicked "Purchase" on the Ward.

> **[System Alert]**
> **Transaction Denied.**
> **Reason:** Weekly purchase limit exceeded.

Victor frowned. He opened his user profile.

> **[USER_7749 Status]**
> **Reputation Tier:** Unverified Contractor
> **Weekly Purchase Limit:** 25,000 GP
> **Current Week Spending:** 7,500 GP
> **Transactions Completed:** 1 / 10 (Tier 1 Unlock Requirement)
> **Next Tier Benefits:** 100,000 GP weekly limit + Bulk Purchase Access

He closed the window. Did the math.

25,000 GP per week. Four weeks in a month. Maximum spending: 100,000 GP.

Target: 1,000,000 GP profit.

"I can't buy my way to the goal." He tapped the pen faster. "I need to sell."

The arbitrage model crystallized in his mind.

**Phase 1:** Buy underpriced divine/exotic goods from desperate sellers (other worlds).

**Phase 2:** Resell on Terra-Insolvia at local market rates (500-3,000% markup).

**Phase 3:** Use profits to complete transactions, increase reputation, unlock higher tiers.

**Phase 4:** Scale.

It was a classic market-making strategy. The kind hedge funds used when entering unregulated territories.

Victor opened the "Create Listing" interface.

He still had the [Miracle: Rain] from yesterday. He didn't need it yet. The southern drought wouldn't peak for another two weeks, according to Barnaby's gossip.

Sell it now. Build capital. Buy more.

He filled out the form:

> **Item:** [Miracle: Rain] (Tier 3 Divine Scroll)
> **Price:** 45,000 GP (Firm)
> **Delivery:** Buyer pays summoning fees
> **Region Filter:** Terra-Insolvia Only

He hesitated at the last field: **[Seller Identification]**.

There were three options:

1. **Public** (Full name visible)
2. **Anonymous** (Username only)
3. **Shell Entity** (Requires Tier 2 Reputation)

Victor selected **Anonymous**.

The listing went live.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Listing Posted:** [Miracle: Rain]
> **Status:** Active
> **Views:** 0
> **Offers:** 0

He leaned back. Waited.

Two minutes later, an **[Incoming Message]** alert flashed.

The sender ID made him pause.

**ADMINISTRATOR_HESTIA.**

He opened it.

> Congratulations on your first transaction, Contractor 7749.
>
> I see you've discovered the arbitrage loophole.
>
> A word of advice: The Exchange monitors *destabilizing trades*.
>
> If you crash a local market (or a divine monopoly), the affected parties will notice.
>
> And they have your signature now.
>
> Every transaction leaves a mana trace. The Church of Eternal Light employs very good auditors. If fifty cheap miracles flood Oakhaven in one week, they'll investigate.
>
> They'll find you.
>
> Consider: diversification. Shell entities. Timed releases.
>
> Or don't. Failure creates excellent case studies.
>
> Happy trading.
> - H.

Victor read it twice.

Hestia wasn't threatening him. She was *teaching* him. Like a professor grading a promising student's first attempt at corporate espionage.

He opened a new document in his notebook.

**Risk Assessment:**

1. **Mana Signature Tracking** → Every Exchange transaction is *traceable*.
2. **Market Flooding** → Selling too many miracles at once = price crash = Church investigates.
3. **Divine Monopoly Retaliation** → Churches won't tolerate competition. They'll audit, sue, or crusade.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

1. **Shell Companies** → Need Tier 2 reputation (9 more transactions).
2. **Volume Control** → Sell no more than 2-3 miracles per week to avoid detection.
3. **Geographic Diversification** → Sell in multiple cities, not just Oakhaven.

He closed the notebook. Looked at the listing.

45,000 GP for a single miracle. If it sold.

But one sale wouldn't be enough. And selling too many would paint a target on his back.

"I'm not just arbitraging prices," Victor muttered. "I'm building a smuggling network across dimensional borders."

The Consortium had handed him a cosmic marketplace.

He was going to exploit every loophole it had.

***

The wagon lurched violently.

Victor's pen rolled off the desk. The hologram flickered.

"Barnaby!" he called out. "What was that?"

No response.

Then, muffled through the dimensional fold: "Boss! We have a problem!"

Victor stood, closing the obsidian card. The hologram vanished. He stepped through the narrow corridor toward the driver's compartment.

When he pushed open the door, cold wind hit his face.

The Gilded Caravan had stopped.

In the middle of the Imperial Highway.

Blocking the road ahead were twelve figures. Human. Armed with short swords and crossbows. They wore mismatched leather armor—the kind scavenged from corpses.

Bandits.

The leader stepped forward. He was missing an ear. His smile was missing more teeth.

"Toll," he said simply. "Five hundred gold. Or we take it from your corpse."

Barnaby leaned over from the driver's bench, whispering: "Boss, these roads are supposed to be *patrolled*. Where are the guards?"

Victor didn't answer. He was watching the bandits. Watching their formation. Their weapons.

They weren't professionals. Just opportunists.

But twelve-to-one odds weren't ideal.

The leader raised a crossbow. Aimed it at Barnaby's chest.

"I don't hear coins," he said. "I hear *stalling*."

Victor stepped down from the wagon. Slowly. He held up his empty hands.

"Gentlemen," he said. "I'm willing to negotiate. But not for gold."

The leader's smile widened. "Oh? What *are* you offering?"

Victor's eyes flashed gold.

"Employment," Victor said. "Or liquidation. Your choice."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Mode:** Hostile Acquisition
> **Targets Identified:** 12
> **Projected Cost:** 240 MP (Mass [Performance Review])
> **ROI Calculation:** In Progress...

The bandits laughed.

Victor didn't.

Because behind them, in the tree line, he'd just spotted movement.

More figures. Twenty. Thirty.

This wasn't a random shakedown.

This was an ambush.

And someone had known exactly when he'd be on this road.

Someone who knew his deadline.

**Word Count**: ~1,850
