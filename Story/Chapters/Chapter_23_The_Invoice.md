# Chapter 23: The Invoice

"You'd let her die?"

Gareth's voice was raw with fury and fear—a volatile combination that Victor recognized from a thousand emergency board meetings. The tank's hand trembled on his broken sword, and Victor could see the calculation happening behind his eyes: kill the goblin now, or save the teammate dying in Finn's arms.

Victor didn't move. Didn't flinch. He held the healing potion in his clawed fingers like a banker holding a mortgage deed.

"I'd prefer she lives," Victor said, his voice perfectly level. "Living customers provide repeat business. But I have costs to consider."

"He's insane," Mira whispered, her staff crackling with the last dregs of her mana. "He's completely insane."

"JUST TELL HIM!" Alara grabbed Gareth's arm, her voice breaking. "She's *dying*, you stubborn—tell him whatever he wants to know!"

The tank's jaw clenched. His pride warred with his duty. For three long seconds, Victor watched the internal struggle play out across Gareth's face—the soldier versus the leader, the pride versus the loyalty.

Loyalty won. It usually did, when the stakes were high enough.

"The Guild is based in Oakhaven," Gareth said, the words coming fast and bitter. "Forty miles southeast. There are five registered parties active in this region. The strongest is the Iron Vanguard—Level 20 and above, led by a guy named Aldric the Unbowed."

Victor nodded, filing the data. "Continue."

"Dungeon bounties are posted monthly by the Regional Command. This dungeon?" Gareth's laugh was hollow. "No bounty. We came on our own. Heard rumors about a 'mystery dungeon' with a boss monster no one had catalogued. Thought we'd get the discovery bonus."

"Discovery bonus?"

"First party to clear an unregistered dungeon gets a twenty percent premium on all loot sales." Gareth's eyes were fixed on Lysa, watching her chest rise and fall in increasingly shallow breaths. "We were going to be famous."

Victor absorbed this. *Incentive structure: clear. Reward mechanisms: exploitable. Risk tolerance: moderate. Recommended action: increase perceived risk while maintaining reward potential.*

"Adequate," Victor said, and tossed the potion.

Gareth caught it one-handed, his reflexes still sharp despite his injuries. He didn't waste time with words—just shoved the cork out with his thumb and poured the liquid down Lysa's throat.

The effect was immediate. Color flooded back into her cheeks. The blood-foam stopped bubbling at her lips. Her breathing steadied, deepened, strengthened.

She wasn't healed—not fully—but she would live. The potion had bought her time. Time to escape. Time to recover. Time to spread the word.

Victor stepped aside, clearing the path to the exit.

"You're free to go," he said. "The exit is on Floor One. Mind the traps on Floor Three—we've been renovating."

The Silver Lance moved. Finn lifted Lysa more securely. Bron took point, his hammer ready for anything. Mira stayed in the center, conserving what little mana she had left. Alara supported Gareth, who could barely walk.

A broken party. A defeated expedition.

*Perfect.*

Gareth stopped at the archway. He turned, and the look in his eyes promised violence.

"This isn't over, goblin," he said. "The Guild will hear about this. About you. About your pet Minotaur. They'll send someone who can actually kill you."

Victor's smile was thin, sharp, utterly without warmth.

"I'm counting on it."

---

The Silver Lance retreated up the stairs. Their footsteps faded into echoes, then into silence.

Victor turned and walked back into the arena.

Asterion hadn't moved. The Minotaur stood in the center of the sand pit, axe resting across his shoulders, blood slowly dripping from a dozen minor wounds that were already closing. His eyes—ancient, measuring—tracked Victor's approach.

"The tribute is delivered," Victor reported, keeping his voice businesslike. "They ran. Six entered, six retreated. Zero fatalities."

"Zero?" Asterion's voice rumbled with something that might have been disappointment.

"I needed them alive." Victor clasped his hands behind his back. "Corpses don't spread rumors. Survivors do. They'll return to their Guild and report that this dungeon houses a Level 25 boss who nearly killed them. That's valuable publicity."

The Minotaur considered this. His massive head tilted, horns catching the torchlight.

"You think like prey," Asterion observed. "Plotting. Scheming. Using words instead of strength."

"I think like management," Victor corrected. "Which, in your experience, probably looks similar."

A sound emerged from Asterion's chest—a deep, grinding rumble that Victor needed a moment to identify as laughter.

"The paladin," Asterion said. "She had fire. Divine fire. It's been... decades since I faced one who could hurt me."

"You want more like her?"

"I want *challenges*." The Minotaur's grip tightened on his axe. "Worthy opponents. Not lambs to slaughter, but warriors to test myself against. Your 'marketing' will bring them?"

"In time." Victor pulled up his ARMI interface, checking contract status. "This encounter counts as provisional fulfillment. Your disposition toward the arrangement has improved."

> **[ARMI]**
> Contract: [The Guardian's Pact]
> Status: Provisional Fulfillment (1/1 Tribute Delivered)
> Asterion Disposition: NEUTRAL → FAVORABLE
> Note: Full contract completion requires ongoing tribute delivery.

"Favorable," Asterion repeated, tasting the word. "Strange to be judged by a number."

"Everything is a number," Victor said. "That's the first lesson of management."

---

Victor left the arena and made his way back to the command center—the old goblin throne room that he'd slowly been converting into something resembling an office.

Sniv was waiting, practically vibrating with excitement.

"Boss! Boss traded water for whispers! Sniv watched through the crystal!"

"Information is currency," Victor said, settling onto his stone throne. "And I just acquired significant market data. The Adventurer's Guild, their structure, their incentive systems. This is actionable intelligence."

"Sniv not understand 'actionable.'"

"It means I can *use* it."

A small shape emerged from behind a pillar—and for a moment, Victor's hand went to the knife he didn't actually carry. Then he processed what he was seeing.

Not a goblin. Something smaller. Scalier. With oversized eyes and hands that seemed designed for manipulation rather than combat.

A Kobold.

"What," Victor said flatly, "is that?"

Sniv beamed with pride. "Sniv found! While Boss watched fight! Hiding in Floor Two! Very scared! Sniv did NOT eat!"

The Kobold pressed itself against the floor in what was clearly a submission posture.

"Zip no fight!" it squeaked, its Common heavily accented. "Zip build! Zip make traps! Please no eat Zip!"

Victor's eyes narrowed. He pulled up his assessment skill.

> **[ARMI]**
> Target: Zip
> Classification: Kobold (Trap Specialist)
> Level: 6
> Primary Skills: [Trap Construction], [Mechanical Intuition], [Structural Analysis]
> Weakness: Physical fragility, cowardice
> Value Assessment: HIGH (auxiliary role)

Level 6. A trap specialist. Someone who could actually *build* instead of just following orders.

"Sniv," Victor said slowly, "this might be the most valuable thing you've ever brought me."

The goblin lit up like a Christmas bonus.

"Zip," Victor continued, focusing on the cowering Kobold. "You said you build traps?"

"Yes! Yes! Zip best trap builder! Zip make spiky pits! Zip make swinging logs! Zip make—" The Kobold's voice dropped to an awed whisper. "—FIRE traps."

Victor leaned forward. Fire traps. That was interesting. They'd been relying on acid sacs and mechanical devices so far, but controlled flames would add an entirely new dimension to dungeon defense.

"Tell me more about these fire traps."

The Kobold's eyes lit up with an enthusiasm that Victor recognized—the passion of a true specialist talking about their craft. It was the same look he'd seen on his old CFO when discussing tax optimization strategies.

"Zip know secrets!" The Kobold scrambled to his feet, his fear momentarily forgotten in the face of professional recognition. "Zip learn from old master. Oil on floor—hidden! Trip rope here—" He gestured wildly. "—adventurer step, rope pull, torch fall, WHOOSH! Fire everywhere!"

"Controlled burn radius?"

"Zip... not know big words." The Kobold tilted his head. "But fire go where Zip *want* fire go. Zip dig channels. Fire follow channels. Burn only trap area. Not burn whole floor."

Victor's mental calculator ran the numbers. A Kobold trap specialist with Level 6 skills could revolutionize their defensive infrastructure. The current trap array was functional but primitive—designed by goblins who understood hitting things with rocks, not by engineers who understood systems.

"What else can you build?"

"Zip make pressure plates! Zip make falling ceiling! Zip make—" The Kobold hesitated, glancing nervously at Sniv. "—Zip make goblin launchers?"

"Goblin launchers," Victor repeated flatly.

"Spring mechanism! Very strong! Goblin sit on plate, enemy walk past, SPROING! Goblin fly at enemy!" Zip's enthusiasm was infectious, even if his engineering ethics were questionable. "Enemy very surprised!"

Victor pinched the bridge of his nose. "We'll... table that one for now."

---

Three hours later, Victor had a new department head.

"Sniv," he announced, "promote Zip to Head of R&D."

The goblin blinked. "What is R... and... D?"

"Research and Development." Victor gestured at the Kobold, who was currently sketching trap designs in the dirt with a stick. "He breaks things. He makes better things. He designs systems that make our dungeon more... efficient."

"Sniv understand." The goblin nodded sagely. "Zip make hurt for visitors."

"Exactly."

Victor looked at his growing organization. Twenty-six goblins. One Minotaur ally. One Kobold engineer.

The dungeon was evolving. From mob to organization. From chaos to structure.

And Victor was just getting started.

> **[ARMI]**
> Organizational Update:
> - Workforce: 26 Goblins (Labor/Security)
> - General: Asterion (Boss Monster)
> - R&D Head: Zip (Trap Specialist)
> - HR Director: Sniv (Administrative)
> Status: RESTRUCTURING IN PROGRESS

Not bad for a dead man in a borrowed suit.
