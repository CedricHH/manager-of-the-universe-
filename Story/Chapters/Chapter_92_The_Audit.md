# Chapter 92: The Audit

Victor stepped forward.

Three paladins. Level 18, 18, and 20. Full enchanted plate. Detection wards glowing faintly on their breastplates. The lead—Theron—had his gauntleted hand resting on his sword hilt.

> **[ARMI - Threat Assessment]**
> **Paladin-Commander Theron:** Level 20 (Inquisitorial Authority)
> **Support Paladins:** Level 18 × 2 (Combat Specialists)
> **Authority Scope:** Imperial Highway Jurisdiction
> **Win Probability (Combat):** 12%

Victor didn't reach for a weapon.

He reached for words.

"You're accusing me of divine commerce," Victor said. "But you haven't specified which law I've allegedly broken."

Theron's eyes narrowed. "The Church of Eternal Light holds exclusive rights to miracle distribution within Kingdom borders. Commerce in unauthorized blessings constitutes heresy."

"Interesting." Victor pulled a notebook from his coat. Flipped to a marked page. "Imperial Trade Act, Year 392, Section XII: 'Merchants may trade in enchanted artifacts, blessed items, and divine curiosities provided said items were legally acquired and do not constitute active religious fraud.' I didn't claim the miracle came from *your* gods, Commander. I sold an artifact. Legally acquired. How is that heresy?"

Theron's jaw tightened.

Behind Victor, Kade muttered, "Boss is arguing scripture with a paladin. We're going to die."

Victor ignored him. "Furthermore, this is an Imperial Highway. Dual jurisdiction. Any audit requires an Imperial witness. Do you have one?"

Theron took a step forward. His detection ward pulsed brighter—scanning for dark magic, cursed items, demonic taint.

The Galactic Exchange card in Victor's pocket was *vibrating*.

Victor kept his hands visible. Didn't move.

"You invoke Imperial oversight," Theron said slowly. "That delays any audit by a minimum of forty-eight hours."

"I invoke *proper legal process*," Victor corrected. "Unless the Church of Eternal Light prefers to explain unlawful detention of a crown-chartered merchant to Prince Aldric?"

That landed.

Theron's hand shifted off his sword. "You know the Crown Prince?"

"I pay him fifteen percent of my dungeon revenue," Victor said flatly. "Monthly. He's a business partner. So yes, I *know* him. And I suspect he'd be very interested to learn that Church paladins are interfering with Imperial commerce without following protocol."

Kade's Company had quietly formed a defensive perimeter around the caravan. Forty-two sellswords. Level 12-14. Not enough to win a fight against three paladins, but enough to make it *expensive*.

Theron glanced at them. Then back at Victor.

"Very well," the paladin said. "Imperial Runner will be dispatched. Audit proceeds with **preliminary documentation review** until runner arrives. You will provide: cargo manifest, transaction ledgers, and proof of legal acquisition for all goods."

Victor's mind raced.

The caravan manifest listed goods purchased from "Imperial Waypoint Terminal" (technically true—the Galactic Exchange accessed via Waypoint). But if Theron dug deeper, he'd find transaction records with inter dimensional origins.

That would raise questions Victor couldn't answer.

***

Theron produced a scroll. Unrolled it. "According to our intelligence, Lady Cassia's estate in the southern provinces received a divine miracle this morning. Source: unknown. Delivery method: instantaneous materialization. Purchase price: unconfirmed."

He looked at Victor. "You left Aethelgard three days ago with significant capital. Timeline matches. Opportunity matches. So I'll ask directly: did you sell Lady Cassia a rain miracle?"

Victor met his gaze. "I sold a blessed artifact through an intermediary broker. I don't control who the final buyer is. Merchant confidentiality."

"Convenient."

"Legal."

Theron's fingers drummed on the scroll. "Show me this 'artifact.'"

"Already delivered. Transaction complete."

"How convenient."

"How commerce works," Victor said. "You don't keep groceries after selling them either, Commander."

One of the support paladins stepped forward. "Commander Theron, his detection profile is clean. No dark magic. No demonic taint. No active curses."

Theron frowned. "And the Church intel?"

"Surveillance confirms anomalous mana signature near his caravan two days ago. Consistent with dimensional transfer magic—but that's *legal* under Merchant Guild charter."

Victor kept his expression neutral.

They knew about the dimensional transfer. But they didn't know it was the **Galactic Exchange**. They thought it was standard high-tier merchant magic.

Good.

"Commander," Victor said carefully. "May I ask: how did the Church learn about this transaction in the first place?"

Theron's eyes went cold. "That's classified."

"Because if you have active surveillance on private commercial deals, that violates Imperial Trade Privacy Act, Year 392. Crown Prince Aldric would find that... concerning."

"You accuse the Church of illegal surveillance?"

"I'm clarifying your legal position," Victor said. "Either:"

He counted on his fingers.

"One: The Church monitored my transaction—which is illegal surveillance."

"Two: The Church has an informant among my employees—which is bribery of crown-chartered staff."

"Or three: The Church has a **legitimate source** you're willing to disclose in front of an Imperial witness."

Kade was grinning now. "Boss has a point, Commander. How *did* you know we were on this specific road at this specific time?"

Theron's hand went back to his sword hilt.

> **[ARMI - Escalation Risk]**
> **Probability of Violence:** 34% → 41%
> **Recommendation:** De-escalate or establish leverage

Victor shifted tactics.

"Commander Theron," he said, voice calm. "The Church doesn't want conflict. Neither do I. So let's be transparent. What does the Church *actually* want?"

Theron studied him for a long moment.

Then he exhaled.

"The Church wants to know where you're sourcing miracles," Theron said quietly. "And we want to... ensure those miracles flow through proper channels."

Victor's pulse didn't change. "Proper channels meaning?"

"Channels the Church can regulate. Monitor. Tax."

There it was.

This wasn't an audit.

It was a **recruitment pitch**.

***

"You want me to sell exclusively to the Church," Victor said.

Theron didn't confirm or deny.  Instead: "The Church would pay *very well* for consistent supply agreements. Miracles are in high demand. Southern provinces are... struggling. Drought. Crop failures. Divine intervention is needed."

"And the Church's own miracles?" Victor asked. "Why not produce more internally?"

Theron's jaw tightened.

"That's confidential."

But his silence said everything.

Church miracle production was **declining**. That's why they were desperate enough to intercept Victor on an Imperial road. They weren't trying to eliminate a competitor—they were trying to **secure a supplier**.

Victor crossed his arms. "Interesting proposal, Commander. But I have questions. If I'm supplying the Church, I need to understand production capacity. What's your current miracle output per month?"

"That information is classified."

"Then how do I price a contract?" Victor asked reasonably. "If the Church produces a hundred miracles monthly, my five miracles are irrelevant. But if Church capacity is... *declining*... then I'm a critical vendor. And critical vendors set premium rates."

Theron said nothing.

Victor pressed. "Let's be transparent, Commander. Southern provinces have seven-month drought. Church rain blessings used to succeed ninety percent of the time. Now it's sixty-five percent. Nobles are seeking alternatives. You're not auditing me to enforce law—you're trying to eliminate **market competition**."

"The Church serves the faithful—"

"The Church charges 120,000 gold for blessings that fail one-third of the time," Victor interrupted. "I charge 90,000 gold with guaranteed delivery. That's not heresy, Commander. That's **supply and demand**."

Kade muttered, "Oh, we're definitely going to die."

Theron's hand gripped his sword.

> **[ARMI - Escalation Risk]**
> **Probability of Violence:** 63%
> **Recommendation:** IMMEDIATE DE-ESCALATION

"Commander," Victor said quickly. "I'm not blaspheming. I'm stating market realities. If the Church wants partnership, I'm open to negotiation. But I don't respond to threats—only contracts."

The tension held for three seconds.

Then a horn sounded in the distance.

Imperial Runner.

The forty-eight-hour delay had been accelerated—someone important must have authorized faster response.

Theron looked toward the sound. Then back at Victor.

"This conversation isn't over, Mr. Kaine," the paladin said. "High Priestess Aurelia will hear of your... entrepreneurship. Expect formal summons to Sunspire Cathedral within the week."

"I'll consult my calendar," Victor said.

Theron and his paladins mounted their horses. Rode off toward the approaching Imperial Runner.

Victor watched them go.

***

Kade exhaled. "Boss. What the **hell** just happened?"

"Bureaucratic warfare," Victor said. "They wanted to arrest us. I made it more expensive than it was worth."

"And the part where you told a paladin that the Church is failing?"

"I told him his employer has declining market share. He already knew. I just said it out loud."

Barnaby leaned out from the driver's bench. "Are we still going to Oakhaven, or are we fugitives now?"

"Oakhaven," Victor said. "We're not fugitives. Yet."

The caravan started moving again.

Victor climbed back inside. Opened the Galactic Exchange interface.

> **[ARMI - Alert]**
> **Threat Level:** ESCALATING
> **Church Intelligence:** Partial knowledge of miracle sales
> **Strategic Implication:** Church views Victor as competitive threat

He pulled up the Southern Coalition's message.

> **[LADY_CASSIA]:** Emergency. Church paladins interrogated my estate steward this morning. They know about the miracle. Need immediate secondary delivery to alibi location. Will pay 50% premium.

Victor stared at the message.

Then he read the next one.

> **[LADY_CASSIA]:** Four other Coalition estates were "visited" by Church today. They're hunting the source. We need volume delivery NOW or the rebellion dies.

Victor leaned back.

The Church was escalating.

The Coalition was panicking.

And Victor had twenty-nine days left to make one million gold.

> **[ARMI - Calculation]**
> **Current Capital:** 130,930 GP
> **Coalition Demand:** 70 miracles (estimated 630,000 GP revenue)
> **Church Threat:** ACTIVE
> **Consortium Deadline:** 29 days remaining

He cracked his knuckles.

Typed a message to Lady Cassia.

> **[USER_7749]:** Volume scaling in progress. Prepare advance payment for priority delivery. 48-hour window. Full details upon arrival in Oakhaven.

Then he opened a new calculation window.

**Problem:** Purchase limit of 25,000 GP per week wouldn't scale fast enough.

**Solution:** Unlock Tier 1 (shell company access) via seven more transactions.

**Method:** Micro-arbitrage on high-turnover goods.

Seven transactions. Each needed to look organic. Each needed to build reputation without triggering fraud alerts.

Victor's fingers flew across the holographic keyboard, already calculating purchase sequences, resale margins, timing intervals. The math clicked into place like tumblers in a lock.

It was time to **scale up**.
