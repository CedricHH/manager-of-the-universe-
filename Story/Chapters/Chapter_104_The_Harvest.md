# Chapter 104 - The Harvest

The Automated Slime Farm Alpha sprawled across forty percent of Floor 2.

Victor stood at the edge of the cultivation zone, watching gelatinous masses pulse in their breeding pools. Twenty stone basins, each eight feet wide, fed by channeled mana from the dungeon core. Green health slimes. Blue mana slimes. Yellow stamina slimes. All of them growing, dividing, producing cores at industrial scale.

The harvest wasn't manual. Victor had implemented automation protocols three days ago—mana extractors that pulled cores without killing the slimes, conveyor systems that delivered output to a central processing station.

Twenty-three days to design. Four days to implement. One day to validate.

And now—dawn on harvest day—the system delivered results.

ARMI pulsed against his consciousness.

Victor picked up a health core from the processing bin. Translucent green, pulsing with condensed mana. The core was warm to the touch—living energy contained in crystalline form. It hummed faintly, resonating with his ARMI interface. Perfect quality. Better than ninety percent of market-sourced cores.

"This is... incredible," Marcus said, approaching from the alchemy station. He carried his toolkit—glass vials, reagent pouches, measurement crystals. The former Alchemist Guild officer looked like he'd been working through the night. "Production capacity like this will dominate the market."

"Which is why we're not waiting two weeks," Victor replied. He set the core back in the bin. "We open tomorrow."

Marcus blinked. "Sir?"

"Kira was right. Lysander will notice the Crown Territory loophole soon. We're not giving him time to get an injunction. We open at dawn."

Marcus's expression shifted from confusion to comprehension. "You're forcing his hand."

"I'm establishing precedent," Victor corrected. "First mover advantage. If we launch tomorrow, he has to respond defensively. If we wait, he coordinates opposition and we fight an uphill battle."

Marcus nodded slowly. "That's... aggressive."

"That's business. Can you produce two thousand potions by tomorrow morning?"

The alchemist glanced at the harvest output, calculating. "Yes. But that's only one day's inventory. What if we sell out in hours?"

"We will sell out. That's the point."

---

The strategy room held four people.

Victor. Sniv. Asterion. Marcus.

A map of Oakhaven's Market Quarter spread across the central table—the apothecary's location marked in red, Lysander's Guild Hall in blue, Insolvia Dungeon in green. Three points forming a triangle of contested commerce.

"Original timeline," Victor began without preamble, "was two weeks construction, then launch. New timeline: we open tomorrow."

Asterion's expression didn't change. The minotaur had learned not to question sudden strategic shifts. "What precipitated this acceleration?"

"Kira mentioned the Merchant Guild has Crown connections. If Lysander moves first, he can petition for a territorial ruling. If we launch first, we establish precedent. First mover advantage."

Sniv bounced excitedly. "Goblins are ready! Customer service training complete! Synergy is MAXIMUM!"

Victor glanced at Marcus. "Concerns?"

The alchemist hesitated. "We only have one day's inventory. Two thousand cores equals two thousand potions. What if demand exceeds supply?"

"It will," Victor said. "Deliberately."

He pulled up an ARMI projection—customer flow models, pricing elasticity curves, market penetration estimates. Visual data rendered in glowing blue geometry above the table.

"Lysander taxes sellers fifty percent more in fees and charges premium prices because he controls inventory. We charge eighty percent less and run out immediately. Which one looks more valuable to customers?"

Marcus's eyes widened. "Artificial scarcity as marketing."

"Exactly. Phase two production starts tonight. The farm produces two thousand cores per week. We'll have continuous supply. But day one? We make noise. We force Lysander to respond before he's coordinated a counter-strategy."

Victor dismissed the projection and turned to his team.

"Assignments. Marcus—begin potion production immediately. Target: two thousand potions by dawn. Sniv—deploy goblin shopkeepers to the apothecary tonight. Final prep, inventory stocking, security protocols. Asterion—final security sweep. Prepare for Guild inspectors. They will show up."

"Understood," Asterion said.

"Sniv will work VERY hard!" the goblin declared.

Marcus nodded. "I'll start production now."

ARMI updated the timeline.

> **[ARMI - TIMELINE REVISION]**
> Launch: TOMORROW (accelerated from 11 days)
> Inventory: 2,000 potions (Day 1)
> Projected sellout: 4-6 hours (based on demand projections)
> Lysander response window: 8-12 hours post-launch
> 
> **Risk Assessment**:
> - Premature launch: 34% (acceptable)
> - Guild legal challenge: 72% (expected)
> - Market rejection: 12% (low probability given price advantage)
> 
> **Recommendation**: Proceed with acceleration

"We launch at dawn," Victor repeated. "No delays."

The team dispersed.

Victor remained alone in the strategy room, staring at the map.

Two weeks to prove he could dominate local operations.

Tomorrow, he'd find out if the market agreed.

Marcus worked through the night.

The Potion R&D Division occupied Floor 3—a repurposed cavern chamber, now lined with alchemy benches, reagent storage, and mana stabilization arrays. Fifteen workstations. One master alchemist. Two thousand cores to process.

The production line was efficient:

1. Core extraction—pull concentrated mana from slime core
2. Reagent mixing—standardized formula (Victor's specifications)
3. Stabilization—bind mana to liquid medium without volatility
4. Bottling—crystal vials, cork stoppers, quality seal

Marcus moved through the process with mechanical precision.

A decade in the old Guild under Groll. Twelve years producing potions the traditional way—slow, inconsistent, expensive.

This? This was industrialization.

No contamination. No failed batches. Every core delivered perfect mana density because the slimes were raised in controlled conditions, not harvested wild.

Victor wasn't just selling potions.

He was disrupting the entire alchemical supply chain.

Marcus paused mid-pour, staring at the rows of completed vials.

"He's going to bankrupt the Guild," Marcus murmured to the empty lab. "Not by force. By obsolescence."

The thought should have disturbed him. He'd spent his career in that Guild.

Instead, he felt something close to exhilaration.

This was what alchemy was supposed to be. Precision. Efficiency. Results.

Not political maneuvering and scarcity manipulation.

Marcus returned to work.

By 4 AM, two thousand potions stood bottled and ready.

Sniv supervised final preparations at the apothecary.

The building occupied a narrow storefront adjacent to the Dungeon entrance—a strategic location that qualified as Crown Territory under the Dungeon Commerce Act.

Ten goblin shopkeepers stood in formation, wearing tiny aprons stitched with "INSOLVIA APOTHECARY" in silver thread.

Sniv had drilled them for three days.

Customer service protocols. Upselling techniques. Conflict de-escalation (important—goblins had a natural tendency to bite rude customers).

The checklist was complete:

- [x] Goblins wearing uniforms
- [x] No customers eaten during training (SUCCESS!)
- [x] Upselling techniques memorized ("Would you like SECOND POTION?")
- [x] Cash register functional (makes satisfying "ching" sound)

Asterion's guards patrolled the perimeter—three on active duty, nine on standby rotation. The minotaur had positioned them to cover both entrances and the crowd flow from Market Quarter.

Sniv activated his speaking stone, channeling mana to connect with Victor.

"Boss! Shop is ready! Goblins are VERY professional!"

Victor's response came through the stone, calm and measured. "Good. See you at dawn."

The connection cut.

Sniv looked at his team—ten goblins, twelve guards, one apothecary positioned to upend Oakhaven's entire economic structure.

"We make Boss proud," Sniv announced. "No mistakes. Maximum efficiency!"

The goblins saluted. Sort of. It looked more like synchronized waving.

Good enough.

---

Victor sat in his office at 2 AM, drafting a message.

Not encrypted. Public record. Deliberate.

The letter appeared in ARMI's text interface, rendered in clean administrative formatting:

> **To**: Guild Master Lysander Corvus, Merchant Guild of Oakhaven
> **From**: Victor Kaine, Proprietor of Insolvia Apothecary
> 
> **Subject**: Market Competition Notice
> 
> Guild Master Corvus,
> 
> Effective dawn today, Insolvia Apothecary will offer health, mana, and stamina potions at competitive market rates from our Crown Territory location.
> 
> Our pricing:
> - Health Potion: 10 silver
> - Mana Potion: 15 silver
> - Stamina Potion: 12 silver
> 
> Quality guaranteed to match or exceed market standards.
> 
> As our location qualifies as Crown Territory under the Dungeon Commerce Act, we operate independently of guild licensing requirements.
> 
> This is not a hostile action. This is market innovation.
> 
> I look forward to your professional acknowledgment.
> 
> Respectfully,
> Victor Kaine

He reviewed it twice. No legal vulnerabilities. No actionable threats. Just a polite notification of intent.

Which Lysander would interpret as a legal provocation.

Good.

Victor sent the message through official Guild channels—timestamped, archived, impossible to ignore.

Lysander would either challenge in court (which took months) or pressure the Crown directly (which revealed his political capital).

Either way, Victor controlled the timing.

He closed the messaging interface and leaned back in his chair.

Tomorrow, the market would decide if his calculations were correct.

And if they weren't?

He'd adjust and iterate.

That's what Restructurers did.

---

Guild Master Lysander Corvus was a man who appreciated order.

Thirty-eight years running the Merchant Guild. Thirty-eight years of controlled licensing, predictable fees, and compliant merchants.

The letter arrived with his morning tea.

He read it once. Twice. Three times.

Crown Territory. This... dungeon merchant... was claiming Crown Territory exemption.

If Victor Kaine sold without a license and succeeded, every dungeon in the kingdom could do the same.

This wasn't competition. This was precedent.

Lysander set down the letter carefully. Activated his communication crystal.

"Summon Chief Inspector Greymark. Now."

Within the hour, his enforcement lead arrived—Aldwin Greymark, twenty years experience in Guild regulatory compliance. A man who understood the difference between legal violations and political problems.

"A dungeon merchant is selling potions at eighty percent below market prices," Lysander said without greeting. "From Crown Territory. Without a license."

Greymark frowned. "Technically legal. The Dungeon Commerce Act grants Crown exemption to dungeon-based operations."

"Then we need to close the loophole."

"That requires Crown Council approval. Could take months."

Lysander's jaw tightened. "What can we do now?"

"Surveillance. Document his operations. Find violations. If he's not following health protocols, we have grounds for intervention."

"Then go," Lysander ordered. "Watch him. Find something."

Greymark hesitated. "And if there are no violations?"

Lysander met his gaze. "Then we'll have to be... creative."

The inspector nodded and left.

Lysander turned to the window overlooking Market Quarter.

Somewhere out there, Victor Kaine was preparing to undermine three decades of Guild control.

And Lysander couldn't stop him.

Not yet.

---

Dawn broke over Oakhaven.

Victor stood outside Insolvia Apothecary as the sun rose over Market Quarter, casting golden light across cobblestone streets and merchant stalls.

The line already stretched down the block.

Word had spread fast: Health potions for ten silver. Eighty percent cheaper than market.

Adventurers. Merchants. Common laborers who couldn't afford Guild prices. All waiting.

Sniv bounced excitedly beside him. "Boss! Boss! SO MANY CUSTOMERS! This is VERY good for quarterly revenue!"

Asterion surveyed the crowd, calculating threat vectors. "This is a crowd control nightmare. If they rush the door—"

"They won't," Victor interrupted. "Sniv, open the doors. Four customers at a time. Keep the line orderly."

"Yes, Boss!"

The doors opened.

The first customer—a Level 4 adventurer with worn leather armor—stepped inside, stared at the price board, and immediately bought three health potions.

"Ten silver each?" the adventurer asked, disbelieving.

"Correct," the goblin shopkeeper confirmed.

"I'll take five more."

The transaction completed. Cash register chimed. Customer left smiling.

The line moved.

ARMI tracked sales in real-time:

> **[ARMI - SALES TRACKING]**
> Hour 1: 400 potions sold | Revenue: 4,000 silver (40 GP)
> Hour 2: 800 potions sold | Revenue: 8,000 silver (80 GP)
> Hour 3: 1,200 potions sold | Revenue: 12,000 silver (120 GP)
> Hour 4: 1,600 potions sold | Revenue: 16,000 silver (160 GP)

At hour five, the shelves were nearly empty.

And then Chief Inspector Greymark arrived.

Two Guild inspectors flanked him. Formal robes. Clipboards. Official seals.

They didn't threaten. They just... observed. Took notes. Asked pointed questions.

"Interesting operation, Mr. Kaine," Greymark said, his tone neutral. "Crown Territory exemption is... novel."

"Entirely legal," Victor responded.

Greymark smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. "We'll see. We'll be watching."

The inspectors left.

Victor watched them go, expression unchanging.

ARMI updated the threat matrix.

> **[ARMI - MARKET IMPACT ANALYSIS]**
> Day 1 Results:
> - Sales: 2,000 potions (SOLD OUT)
> - Revenue: 20,000 silver (200 GP)
> - Market penetration: 18% (first day)
> - Merchant Guild response: INITIATED
> 
> **Detected Activity**:
> Guild Inspector surveillance confirmed
> Probability of legal challenge: 78%
> Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks
> 
> **Recommendation**: Prepare legal defenses

Victor closed the shop at noon. SOLD OUT sign hanging in the window.

Phase One complete: Market disruption successful.

Phase Two begins tomorrow: Survive Lysander's legal counter-attack.

And somewhere in the background, the BROKEN CROWN data crystal still glowed on his desk.

Thirteen days to decide.

Victor dismissed the thought.

First, dominate Oakhaven.

Then decide if he was ready to topple governments.
