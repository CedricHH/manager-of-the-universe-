# Chapter 5: The First Paycheck

The Alpha Rat finished its second helping of slime jelly and regarded Victor with eyes that held no hostility—only calculation.

Victor held up another glob of jelly, letting the bioluminescent glow catch its surface.

"One a day," he said, keeping his voice calm and steady. "Every day. You don't eat my people. I don't burn your nest. Are we in agreement?"

The Alpha's whiskers twitched. It couldn't understand the words, but body language was universal. The offering. The steady gaze. The complete absence of threat.

The massive rat turned and padded back into the nest. The pack followed, chittering quietly among themselves. None of them looked back at Victor's team with hunger.

Not a contract. Not a binding commitment. Just an understanding between two creatures who had decided—for now—that cooperation was more profitable than conflict.

Victor turned to his team. "We're done here. Back to base."

---

The return journey took fifteen minutes. By the time they climbed the stairs to the Boss Chamber—Floor One, Victor had mentally rebranded it—the waiting goblins had worked themselves into a state of near-mutiny.

He could see it in their eyes. The pack leader who had agreed to Victor's "probationary employment" was pacing, his scarred face twisted with barely contained aggression. The others clustered in groups, whispering. Calculating. Hungry.

The four-hour deadline had passed. The contract was dissolving.

Victor didn't hesitate. He strode into the chamber, untied the collection bag, and dumped his remaining thirteen slime jellies onto the stone floor.

"Dinner," he announced. "One per goblin. Ration it."

They descended like locusts.

For thirty seconds, nothing existed except the wet sounds of consumption and the small, satisfied grunts of creatures who had expected starvation and received sustenance instead. Victor watched them eat, cataloguing their behavior, their hierarchies, their individual quirks.

The pack leader ate first—that was expected. But he only took one jelly, leaving the rest for others. Interesting. Either he was establishing dominance through restraint, or he understood that a dead workforce couldn't serve him later.

*He's learning. They all are.*

When the feeding frenzy subsided, Victor saw something in their eyes that he hadn't seen before. Not the fear that had defined their initial submission. Not the calculation of predators measuring their prey.

Hope. Or something close enough to it.

"Eating is break time," Victor said, his voice cutting through the satisfied silence. "Break time is fifteen minutes. Starting now." He pointed at the sundial Marcus had drawn on the floor—useless for actual timekeeping in a dungeon without sunlight, but good enough for establishing the concept. "When the shadow moves past the second mark, we work."

The goblins stared at him. Work? They had just secured food. Didn't that mean they could rest?

"This meal came from two hours of effort by five workers," Victor continued. "There are fourteen of you. If everyone contributes, we eat better tomorrow. If you don't contribute, you don't eat. Simple mathematics."

He began assigning roles.

"You four—" he pointed at the largest goblins "—clean this chamber. Sweep the bones into the corner. Scrub the floor where the... processing happened. I want to be able to walk without stepping in anything organic."

The goblins exchanged confused glances but didn't argue.

"You four—report to Floor Two. Collect mushrooms. The blue ones are edible. The green ones glow but taste like rot. Avoid the orange ones entirely; they're toxic. Bring back as many blue ones as you can carry."

Another group moved toward the stairs.

"You four—guard duty. Two at the top of the stairs, two at the chamber entrance. Anything approaches that isn't ours, you report. You don't fight. You report. Clear?"

Reluctant nods.

That left Sniv, who had been hovering at Victor's elbow throughout the assignments.

"You," Victor said, "are inventory management. Count everything we have. Jellies, mushrooms, acid sacs, anything else that might have value. I want numbers by the time the guards change shift."

Sniv's yellow eyes widened with something approaching religious fervor. "Sniv count. Sniv count very good. Boss see."

He scurried off toward the collection bags.

Victor watched his workforce disperse—reluctantly, imperfectly, but moving nonetheless. It wasn't a corporation. It wasn't even a functional team. But it was the beginning of something.

*Structure creates output. Output creates value. Value creates survival.*

---

While the goblins worked, Victor turned his attention to the acid sacs they'd collected from the hunt. Three of them, each about the size of a small egg, their membranes straining with caustic fluid.

He selected a spot near the chamber wall—away from his sleeping area, away from the stored supplies—and carefully punctured one sac, squeezing a thin stream of acid onto ordinary stone.

The reaction was immediate. The acid hissed and smoked, eating into the rock with visible speed. Within seconds, a shallow pit had formed where the stone had been.

*Acid grenades. Primitive, dangerous, but viable.*

Victor spent thirty minutes experimenting with the remaining sacs. The key was the membrane—too thin and it would leak, too thick and the impact wouldn't rupture it. He needed a delivery mechanism that would survive throwing but break on contact.

*File for later. Current priority: rest.*

The thought came unbidden, accompanied by a wave of exhaustion that nearly drove him to his knees. He'd been awake for—how long? Sixteen hours? Twenty? Time blurred in the dungeons eternal twilight.

Victor found Sniv and delegated night watch responsibilities.

"If anything moves that isn't ours, wake me. Don't try to handle it yourself. Don't try to negotiate. Just wake me."

Sniv nodded solemnly. "Sniv watch. Sniv guard. Boss sleep safe."

Victor climbed onto the broken throne—still uncomfortable, still cold, still the closest thing to a bed he had—and closed his eyes.

Sleep came instantly.

---

*A boardroom. Glass walls overlooking a city that might have been New York or Tokyo or a dozen other metropolises where power wore suits and spoke in quarterly projections.*

*A woman's voice: "Victor, you can't just cut two hundred jobs."*

*His own response, cold and certain: "The numbers don't lie, Sarah. The division is bleeding money. Every month we delay costs the shareholders forty million."*

*"They're people, Victor. Families. Children who need—"*

*"They're line items. And I was hired to balance the books."*

*A door slamming. Footsteps retreating. The click of heels on marble fading into silence.*

*An empty apartment. Expensive furniture. A glass of whiskey that never seemed to empty no matter how much he drank.*

*And somewhere, buried deep beneath the spreadsheets and the severance packages and the stock options, a voice that sounded almost like his own:*

*"Was it worth it?"*

---

Victor woke.

Four hours had passed. Sniv was crouched beside the throne, his yellow eyes fixed on Victor's face with an expression of profound confusion.

"Boss made water from eyes," the small goblin said. "Is leaking? Sniv see humans leak water from face when dying."

Victor touched his cheek. Wet.

*Tears. I was crying.*

"Condensation," he said flatly. "The caves are damp. It's nothing."

He sat up, wiping his face with his sleeve. The dream was already fading—fragments of glass and steel, a woman's voice, an empty apartment—but the feeling remained. The hollow ache of something lost. Something important.

*Sarah. Who was Sarah?*

The question slipped away before he could grasp it.

The ground trembled.

It started as a vibration—subtle, almost imperceptible. Then it grew. 
 
The stone floor shook. Dust rained from the ceiling. Somewhere in the distance, something *roared*.

Not a goblin. Not a rat. Not a slime.

Something massive. Something primal. Something that shook the dungeon to its foundations with nothing but its voice.

The goblins froze. Even the ones who had been bickering over sleeping spots went silent, their yellow eyes wide with ancient terror.

"Big thing," Sniv whispered. "Cow-man. He wake."

Victor looked toward the stairs that led down—down to Floor Four, down to whatever ancient monster had claimed the depths as its territory.

"The neighbors are noisy," he murmured.

Another roar echoed through the stone. Closer this time. Angrier.

"For now," Victor said, raising his voice so all fourteen goblins could hear, "nobody goes below Floor Three. We reinforce the doors, we maintain watch rotations, and we stay out of its territory. Clear?"

Nods. Fearful, desperate nods.

Victor sat back on his throne and stared at the stairs. Somewhere below, something very large and very dangerous was awake. Something he would eventually have to deal with.

But not today. Today, he had employees. He had food. He had the beginnings of an operation.

The rest could wait.
