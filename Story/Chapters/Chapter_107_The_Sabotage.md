# Chapter 107 - The Sabotage

Forty-eight hours after the Council victory. Victor sat in his Core Chamber office reviewing revenue projections when Marcus entered with a procurement report.

And a problem.

"Halphen's Alchemical Supply rejected our reagent order," Marcus said, voice carefully controlled. "Zero explanation. Just 'cannot fulfill request at this time.'"

Victor's fingers stopped moving across the ARMI interface. Halphen's had been their primary supplier for three weeks—reliable delivery, competitive wholesale pricing, professional service.

Until now.

"Contact status?" Victor asked.

"I called personally. Halphen himself answered, recognized my voice, and immediately claimed inventory shortage. When I offered double price for emergency stock, he hung up."

Victor pulled up ARMI's supplier network visualization. Halphen's Alchemical Supply: established 1142, owner Gregor Halphen (58 years old, second-generation operator), Merchant Guild member since 1165.

Thirty-eight year Guild membership.

Same tenure as Lysander Corvus.

"Check backup suppliers," Victor said. "All seven on the contingency list."

Marcus had already started. Phone calls, speaking stones, messenger runners to every major alchemical reagent operation in Oakhaven.

Twelve minutes later, Marcus reported results.

Every supplier either "experiencing stock shortages," "unable to accommodate new clients," or "prioritizing existing Guild contracts."

Seven suppliers. Seven refusals.

Coordinated. Simultaneous. Professional.

Victor leaned back in his chair, expression neutral, mind calculating threat vectors.

> **[ARMI - SUPPLY CHAIN ANALYSIS]**

Phase 3.

Lysander had warned him. Forty-eight hours, he'd said.

Legal warfare failed. Political warfare failed. Now: supply chain strangulation.

"Elegant," Victor murmured.

Marcus looked up sharply. "Elegant?"

"Lysander spent thirty-eight years building institutional relationships. Supplier mentorships, business partnerships, Guild loyalty networks. He's calling in decades of favors to create a coordinated blacklist. No laws broken. No coercion required. Just social capital weaponized."

Victor stood and activated the Core Chamber's central tactical display. Summoned his crisis team.

Asterion arrived first—full combat armor despite the zero combat probability. Sniv scrambled in seconds later, notepad ready, eyes alert for assignments.

Victor outlined the situation with mathematical precision.

"Supply chain blacklist. Seven major suppliers refusing service simultaneously. Three days operational runway before apothecary shuts down. Lysander's using institutional power to starve us out."

He projected the economic timeline.

"Day 4: We close doors. Day 7: Customers return to Guild vendors—they charge fifty silver again, we're memory. Day 14: Operation bankrupt, Lysander's monopoly restored, our entire Arc 2 strategy collapses."

Asterion's expression darkened. "Can we force suppliers to sell?"

"No. They're within legal rights to refuse service. And threatening them plays into Lysander's narrative—'unlicensed operator using violence to circumvent proper channels.'"

"Then we're screwed," Marcus said quietly.

"No," Victor corrected. "We're *pressured*. Different condition. Pressure creates options."

He pulled up ARMI's dual-solution framework.

"Two parallel strategies. First: external procurement. Second: vertical integration."

> **[ARMI - COUNTERMEASURE PROTOCOLS]**
>
> **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**: External procurement
> - Target: Westhold (neutral merchant city, 140 miles north)
> - Suppliers: 3 independent alchemical operations (non-Guild affiliated)
> - Timeline: 2-day travel each direction = 4-day round trip
> - Cost: 2,500 GP (3x normal wholesale, crisis premium acceptable)
> - Yield: 7-day emergency supply (buys time for long-term solution)
>
> **LONG-TERM SOLUTION**: Vertical integration
> - Objective: Dungeon-based reagent synthesis
> - Resources: Floor 4 (Jungle) herbs, Floor 3 (Underdark) minerals
> - Timeline: Experimental phase (immediate), production scaling (7-14 days)
> - Cost: R&D investment (~500 GP equipment), zero recurring supplier dependency
> - Strategic value: Immune to supply chain warfare permanently

Victor turned to Marcus and Asterion.

"Marcus, Asterion: You're traveling to Westhold immediately. Contact independent suppliers, secure seven-day emergency stock. Use the Gilded Caravan for dimensional cargo transport. Budget: twenty-five hundred gold."

Marcus nodded grimly. "Four-day round trip puts us back on Day 4—exactly when inventory hits zero."

"Correct. Zero margin for delay. Road conditions, weather, supplier negotiations—everything must proceed optimally."

"And if something goes wrong?" Asterion asked.

"Then I synthesize substitutes myself," Victor replied. "Which brings us to the long-term solution."

He pulled up dungeon resource surveys.

"Sniv: Coordinate with Nova. I want complete resource inventories from Floors 1 through 5. Herbs, minerals, organic compounds, mana-reactive materials. Anything with alchemical properties. Target: reagent substitutes we can produce internally."

Sniv saluted. "Boss! Sniv will find MAXIMUM dungeon resources! Nova will help!"

"Start immediately. I'll begin experimental synthesis while Marcus is traveling."

He dismissed the tactical display and met each team member's eyes.

"Lysander thinks he's using institutional power to strangle a merchant operation. He's assuming I'm purely a trader—buy low, sell high, dependent on external supply chains. He doesn't understand I control *production infrastructure*."

Victor gestured toward the dungeon entrance.

"This isn't a store attached to a dungeon. It's a dungeon that happens to run a store. Lysander's attacking my distribution while ignoring my manufacturing base. That's his strategic error."

Marcus grabbed his travel pack. "We leave in thirty minutes."

"Twenty," Victor corrected. "Every hour counts."

The team dispersed.

Victor remained in the Core Chamber, alone except for ARMI's persistent countdown.

> **[BROKEN CROWN DEADLINE: 8 DAYS]**

Eight days to decide if he was ready to topple governments on Terra-Solvaris.

But first: survive Lysander's siege.

Priorities.

---

Four hours later. Victor stood in Marcus's converted alchemy lab—temporarily his experimental workspace—surrounded by dungeon-harvested materials.

Nova had delivered preliminary survey results via ARMI interface.

Floor 4 (Jungle biome): 17 identified herb species, 8 with confirmed alchemical properties. Includes Essence Moss (mana-reactive, similar to commercial Silvervein), Crimson Root (catalytic properties), and Voidshade Leaf (stabilizer compound).

Floor 3 (Underdark): 6 mineral deposits. Crystal formations with mana-conductive properties analogous to reagent catalysts.

Floor 1 (Goblin Warren): Slime cores (already proven substitute for mana storage in potion bases).

Theoretical synthesis pathway: Combine jungle herbs + underdark minerals + slime core essence to create reagent substitute.

Success probability: Unknown. Commercial reagents represented decades of alchemical R&D and standardization. Victor had four hours of dungeon resource knowledge and basic chemistry equipment.

But necessity outweighed probability.

He began methodically.

**Test 1**: Essence Moss + underdark crystal dust + slime core base.
- Result: 64% efficacy vs. commercial reagent. Unstable compound—degraded after 12 minutes.

**Test 2**: Crimson Root extract + crushed quartz + refined slime essence.
- Result: 71% efficacy. More stable (22-minute degradation), but insufficient purity.

**Test 3**: Combined approach—Essence Moss + Crimson Root + Voidshade Leaf (stabilizer) + crystal catalyst + triple-refined slime base.
- Result: 83% efficacy. Stable compound (4+ hour degradation window). Usable.

Victor recorded data with clinical precision.

> **[ARMI - SYNTHESIS ANALYSIS]**
> Commercial reagent (Halphen's): 10 GP/unit wholesale cost
> Dungeon-synthesized substitute: 2 GP/unit production cost (if scaled)
> Efficacy: 83% (acceptable for health potion production)
>
> **Scaling Requirements**:
> - Floor 4 herb farm expansion (200 GP infrastructure)
> - Floor 3 mineral extraction operation (150 GP equipment)
> - Synthesis process standardization (50 GP training)
> Total investment: 400 GP
>
> **Strategic Implication**:
> Vertical integration = zero external supplier dependency
> Immune to supply chain warfare permanently
> Margin improvement: 80% cost reduction vs. commercial reagents

Eighty-three percent wasn't perfect.

But it was *independent*.

Lysander couldn't blacklist dungeon floors.

Victor mixed another batch—this time documenting exact ratios, processing temperatures, refinement steps. Creating a procedure Marcus could replicate at scale.

The lab door opened. Asterion and Marcus, travel gear packed, Gilded Caravan ready.

"Leaving now," Marcus reported. "Westhold contacts confirmed availability. Four-day timeline holds if road conditions cooperate."

Victor handed him the documented synthesis procedure.

"Backup protocol. If you're delayed past Day 4, I'll start producing substitutes using this formula. Eighty-three percent efficacy. Not ideal, but functional."

Marcus scanned the document, eyebrows rising. "You reverse-engineered commercial reagents in four hours?"

"I created an *adequate substitute* in four hours," Victor corrected. "There's a difference. Commercial reagents represent industrial optimization. This is emergency field improvisation."

"Still impressive."

"It's necessary. Move."

Asterion and Marcus departed.

Victor returned to his experiments. Refining compound stability. Optimizing yield ratios. Preparing for the scenario where external procurement failed and dungeon synthesis became primary production method.

ARMI tracked dual timelines simultaneously:

Timeline A (External): Marcus/Asterion return Day 4 with emergency supply (7-day runway extension).

Timeline B (Internal): Victor scales synthesis to full production by Day 5 (permanent independence).

Optimal outcome: Both succeed. Marcus provides immediate relief while Victor achieves long-term autonomy.

Acceptable outcome: Either succeeds alone.

Unacceptable outcome: Both fail. Apothecary closes. Guild monopoly restored.

Probability of unacceptable outcome: 17%.

Victor worked through the night.

---

Midnight. Twelve hours after the blacklist revelation.

Victor received ARMI alert while documenting Test 11 (89% efficacy—improvement via adjusted stabilizer ratios).

> **[ARMI - INTELLIGENCE INTERCEPT]**
> Source: Valerius (double-agent, Merchant Guild internal network)
> Classification: PRIORITY
>
> **Alert**: Emergency Merchant Guild Assembly
> Time: Tonight, 8 PM (Guildhall, restricted session)
> Participants: All Guild members (attendance mandatory)
> Topic (official): "Coordinated Response to Unlicensed Dungeon Commerce"
> Topic (suspected): Formalize BlackList protocols, expand to secondary markets

Victor pulled up the full intercept.

Valerius's intelligence report (delivered via encrypted speaking stone):

*"Lysander's called full assembly—first emergency session in eleven years. Agenda includes 'protective market coordination' and 'Guild member support during unfair competition.' Translation: He's formalizing the reagent blacklist and expanding it."*

*"Secondary targets mentioned: ore suppliers (your slime farm needs iron cages), equipment vendors (Marcus needs lab tools), and food provisions (your staff eats). He's not just targeting potions. He's targeting your entire operation."*

*"Legal? Technically yes—Guild members coordinating 'mutual support.' Reality? Economic siege expanding from reagents to total supply embargo."*

Victor dismissed the alert and checked current inventory across all operation categories.

Reagents: 3 days (being addressed).
Iron/steel (slime farm cages): 2 weeks.
Laboratory equipment: 1 month.
Food supplies (goblin staff, guards): 10 days.

If Lysander expanded the blacklist to all markets, those timelines compressed dramatically.

This wasn't just about potions anymore.

This was systematic economic strangulation designed to shut down his entire Oakhaven operation and force either bankruptcy or Guild membership on Lysander's terms.

Standard corporate siege tactics. Victor had seen it before—Earth's telecommunications consolidation wars, pharmaceutical merger campaigns, retail sector hostile takeovers.

Starve the disruption until it surrenders or dies.

Respectable strategy.

But Victor had two advantages Lysander didn't account for:

First: The dungeon itself. Internal production capability that no external blacklist could touch.

Second: Time pressure working both directions. Lysander assumed Victor would fold within two weeks. But every day Victor stayed operational, Guild vendors lost customers. Adventurers enjoying ten-silver potions didn't want to return to fifty-silver monopoly pricing.

Lysander had political capital. Victor had market momentum.

The question: Which asset depleted first?

Victor returned to synthesis experiments.

Test 12 yielded 91% efficacy.

Close enough to commercial standard that customers wouldn't notice quality difference.

And at two gold production cost versus ten gold wholesale, margin improved by 80% while achieving supply chain independence.

Let Lysander coordinate his institutional network.

Three days to prove dungeons could out-produce thirty-eight years of Guild relationships.

Victor measured out another batch of jungle moss. The synthesis solution turned from amber to crystalline blue—92% efficacy, stable compound.

He recorded the result and checked the timeline.

Marcus: 4 days until return.
Inventory: 3 days until zero.
Lysander's assembly: Expanding the blacklist tonight.

The lab equipment hummed. Slime essence bubbled.

Chemistry didn't care about Guild politics. Neither did Victor.

And in eight days, he'd decide if Terra-Solvaris was ready for the same lesson.
