# Chapter 22: The Performance

Gareth's shield shattered on the first impact.

Not cracked. Not dented. *Shattered*. Three hundred gold worth of enchanted steel exploding into fragments that pinged off the arena walls like metallic rain.

Victor's internal calculator updated in real-time: *Shield durability exceeded by 340%. Force coefficient suggests Level 25+ strength enhancement. Note: Do not engage in melee.*

"HOLY SHIT!" Bron roared, already swinging his hammer at Asterion's exposed flank. "He's FAST!"

The Minotaur didn't even look. His hoof snapped backward, catching Bron in the chest and launching the Berserker across the arena. Bron hit a pillar at roughly the speed of market enthusiasm after a dividend cut. The pillar cracked. Bron didn't get up immediately.

Victor watched from behind his stone column, cataloguing data with the detachment of an observer at a particularly violent quarterly review.

The Silver Lance was coordinating. Professional. Efficient. They had clearly done this before—fought boss monsters, survived dungeons, collected bounties. Their movements had the clockwork precision of experienced killers.

Gareth, shieldless now, was buying time with his sword. Parrying wasn't possible—Asterion's axe would bisect the blade—so he was dodging. Rolling. Using footwork that spoke of expensive training.

Finn had vanished into shadows. Rogue training. He'd be looking for an opening, a moment when Asterion's guard dropped.

Mira was chanting. Fire gathered around her staff in spiraling patterns that hurt to look at. A charged attack, then. High damage, long cast time.

Lysa, the support, was maintaining a shimmering barrier around the party—damage mitigation, probably. Some kind of defensive ward.

And Alara...

Alara was *praying*.

Golden light built around her holy symbol. Victor recognized the cadence from the church marketing materials he'd analyzed in a previous life—divine power invocation, celestial favor request. She was calling for backup.

Interesting. The paladin was the party's ace.

Asterion finished his charge through Gareth's position—the tank had barely dodged—and pivoted toward Mira. The mage was mid-cast, vulnerable, her defensive barriers focused on projected damage rather than physical impact.

"COVER HER!" Gareth screamed.

Finn materialized from shadow, twin daggers aimed at the Minotaur's exposed hamstring. A clean crippling blow, if it landed.

It didn't land.

Asterion's tail—Victor had forgotten about the tail—swept backward and caught Finn across the torso. The rogue went flying, his carefully planned assassination attempt converted into an unscheduled flight lesson.

"Three centuries," Asterion rumbled, his voice echoing across the chamber. "Three centuries of adventurers who think they know my blind spots."

He caught Mira's fireball on his forearm. The flames exploded against his hide, blackening fur and searing flesh. Asterion didn't flinch.

"You are not the first mage," he continued, advancing. "You will not be the last."

Victor's assessment updated: *Pain tolerance confirmed at absolute. Fire damage: superficial. Magic resistance: significant. Recommendation: pray.*

Then Alara finished her prayer.

"**[HOLY SMITE]!**"

A column of golden light descended from somewhere the dungeon ceiling shouldn't have been able to connect to. It struck Asterion dead center, and for the first time in the fight, the Minotaur *staggered*.

He bled.

Black blood, thick as tar, dripping from wounds that glowed with residual divine energy. Asterion looked down at his chest, at the smoking hole in his fur where the smite had landed.

Then he looked at Alara.

"Divine magic," he said. Something changed in his voice. Something that might have been respect. Or might have been target acquisition. "You brought a *priest*."

"Paladin," Alara corrected, her holy symbol blazing. "Sister Alara of the Sun Temple. And you, monster, will fall."

"Perhaps." Asterion's grip tightened on his axe. "But not before your healer does."

He moved.

Victor had seen fast before. Executives escaping scandal. Lawyers dodging liability. Politicians evading questions. None of them moved like Asterion moved—a blur of muscle and murder that crossed the arena in three strides.

Lysa barely had time to scream.

The Minotaur's fist—not the axe, just his *fist*—caught her in the chest. The support mage crumpled like a quarterly projection meeting reality. She hit the sand and didn't move.

"LYSA!" Gareth's voice cracked. The professional calm was gone. This was panic. This was watching a coworker get fired—if firing involved internal hemorrhaging.

Alara was already moving, golden light gathering for another smite. But Asterion had learned. He didn't let her finish the prayer this time.

He charged.

Not Alara—Gareth. The tank tried to intercept, tried to body-block, tried to be the wall he was supposed to be. Asterion hit him like a corporation hitting a small business. Gareth went down, his sword clattering away across the sand.

Now Alara was exposed. No tank. No support. Just a paladin, a downed rogue, an exhausted mage, and a Berserker who was only now staggering back to his feet.

"Run," Bron growled, blood dripping from a head wound. "Get Lysa. RUN!"

The retreat was ugly. Finn, limping, grabbed Lysa's unconscious form. Mira provided cover fire—weak, desperate fireballs that Asterion didn't bother to dodge. Gareth crawled toward his sword.

Alara didn't run.

She planted her feet.

"**[DIVINE SHIELD]!**"

A barrier of solid light materialized between Asterion and the fleeing party. The Minotaur's axe hit it once, twice, three times. Cracks spiderwebbed across the golden surface.

"Go," Alara hissed through gritted teeth. "I'll hold him."

"Fifteen seconds," Victor calculated from his observation post. "Maybe twenty. Impressive dedication. Terrible resource allocation."

The Silver Lance ran. Alara held. The barrier cracked.

And Victor made a decision.

He wasn't going to help them. That would be inefficient—these adventurers were technically customers of his competitor (the Guild), and customer loyalty was notoriously difficult to break.

But he wasn't going to let them all die, either.

Dead adventurers were just corpses. Corpses had limited utility. But *survivors*—survivors who had witnessed a Level 25 boss fight and lived to tell the tale—survivors were *marketing*.

Victor's mind raced through the possibilities. If the Silver Lance died here, no one would know. The dungeon would remain obscure, unmarked, just another death trap in a world full of them. But if they *survived*—if they limped back to the Guild with stories of horror and near-death—

That was advertising. Free advertising. The kind money couldn't buy.

He needed them alive. But he needed something from them first.

---

The surviving members of the Silver Lance reached the stairs at the same moment the barrier shattered. Behind them, Asterion stood in the arena, axe dripping with nothing—Alara had retreated at the last possible moment, but she'd burned everything. No divine power left. No miracles remaining.

Just exhaustion and desperation.

Victor stepped out from behind his pillar and directly into their path.

"Leaving so soon?"

Gareth's sword came up. Broken, chipped, but still lethal. "Get out of the way or I swear to every god—"

"She's dying."

The words stopped Gareth cold.

Victor nodded toward Lysa, still unconscious in Finn's arms. "Internal bleeding. Punctured lung, if I'm reading the blood-foam correctly. Your paladin is tapped out. Your potions are emergency-grade at best. You have maybe fifteen minutes before she's not your problem anymore."

"What the hell do you want?" Alara demanded. She was swaying on her feet, barely upright.

"Information." Victor produced the healing potion from his inventory—the only one he had, the one he'd been saving for actual emergencies. "This is a high-grade regenerative. Military-specification. It will stabilize her."

Mira's eyes narrowed. "And the price?"

"Everything you know about the Adventurer's Guild." Victor's voice was pure boardroom. Pure negotiation. "Structure. Leadership. Pricing. Political affiliations. Contract specifications. Where they recruit. How they train. What they fear."

"You want intel," Gareth said slowly. "To attack the Guild?"

"I want *market research*." Victor shrugged. "What I do with it is my business. Your business is saving your teammate. The exchange rate is simple: information for medicine. Time is a factor."

Lysa coughed blood.

The Silver Lance exchanged glances. Gareth looked at Alara. Alara looked at the potion.

"You're a monster," Alara said.

"I'm a manager," Victor corrected. "Monsters kill. I *negotiate*. The potion, or the corpse. Your choice. You have sixty seconds before the offer expires."

Forty-seven seconds passed.

"Fine," Gareth said. "Give her the potion. Then we talk."

Victor smiled. It wasn't a pleasant expression on goblin features.

"I believe we have a deal."

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Information Acquisition]
> Cost: 1 High-Grade Health Potion
> Return: Strategic Intelligence (Adventurer's Guild)
> Profit Margin: UNDEFINED (Pending Intel Quality)
> Status: PROCESSING

He tossed the potion to Finn. The rogue caught it, popped the cork, and poured it down Lysa's throat with hands that shook only slightly.

Color returned to her cheeks. The blood-foam stopped. She would live.

And Victor would learn.

Behind them, in the arena, Asterion watched. The Minotaur's expression was unreadable.

But Victor thought he saw something that might have been approval.
