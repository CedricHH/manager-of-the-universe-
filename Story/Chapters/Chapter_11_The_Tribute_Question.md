# Chapter 11: The Tribute Question

Victor convened the Board at dawn.

The "Board" consisted of five goblins: Sniv (Chief of Staff), Guard-1 and Guard-2 (Security), Mining-Lead (Operations), and Farm-Lead (Logistics). They gathered in the Boss Chamber, standing nervously around the newly constructed stone table Victor had ordered. It was a crude thing—a slab of grey granite hauled up from Floor Two and smoothed out with broken adventurer shields—but it served its symbolic purpose.

In the corporate world, the table was the neutral ground where logic was supposed to prevail. In this dungeon, it was just another edge to hide behind.

They looked terrified. Not just standard goblin paranoia, but deep, ancestral dread. Even Sniv, who had seen Victor reshape the very nature of their tribe, kept his eyes glued to the rough-hewn surface of the table.

"The situation is simple," Victor began, his voice echoing off the cold stone walls. "The tenant on Floor Four has demanded rent."

He looked at each of them in turn.

"We have three days. The demand is: twenty percent of our food, ten percent of our wealth, or one soul per month."

Farming-Lead—a goblin named Root with chronic sniffles—trembled so hard his clipboard rattled. "Twenty percent is much food. Very much. Winter comes. We starve if we give. High-grass outside dies, mushrooms slow down. If Cow-Man takes, we die in dark."

"And we have no wealth yet," Victor pointed out, his tone dry. "The iron ore is potential wealth, not actual wealth. We can't pay ten percent of potential. In my world, we call that a paper gain. It's useless for paying bills."

"Then soul?" Guard-2 asked. He was the most practical of the group, a survivalist who viewed every goblin as a component in a machine. He touched the hilt of his crude spear. "We have twenty-six. Can spare one. Maybe Labor-15. He slow. He eats more than he digs. If we give him, Cow-Man is full, and twenty-five stay alive."

The other goblins shifted. Some nodded—a grim, desperate calculus. It was the same math that had kept their species alive for millennia: throw the weakest to the wolf and keep the pack moving.

Victor slammed his hand on the table. The sharp crack made all five goblins jump.

"No."

The word hung in the air. Absolute. Non-negotiable.

"We do not sacrifice employees. Ever. That is the quickest way to destroy morale and ensure that the next time, *you* might be the one on the block." Victor leaned forward, his analytical gaze pinning each of them in turn. "If we pay the soul tribute once, we pay it forever. Until there's no one left but me and a very well-fed Minotaur. From a resource management perspective, it's a spiral toward bankruptcy."

Sniv nodded vigorously, clearly relieved that he wasn't on the menu for today's departmental cuts. "Boss is right! If we give Labor-15, then Labor-14 is next. Then Sniv! Then Guard-2! No more gobs!"

"Then what choice?" Mining-Lead asked, scratching his scarred chin. "Fight?"

Guard-1 snorted. "Fight Cow-Man? Cow-Man kill whole parties. Cow-Man tear Marcus in half like wet bread. We die. Spears go *snap* on his skin. Magic goes *pop* on his head."

"So we can't pay, and we can't fight," Victor summarized. He leaned back in his throne, his fingers steepled. It was a classic "distressed asset" scenario. He had a creditor moving in for a hostile takeover, and he had no liquid capital to buy them off. 

In New York, he would have filed for Chapter 11. Here, Chapter 11 was currently the chapter of his life. 

"Run," Root suggested, his voice small. "Leave dungeon. Find new cave. Far away. Deep in mountains. Cow-Man too big for small holes."

The other goblins murmured agreement. Running was a strategy they understood. It had kept their species alive for millennia.

Victor stood up and walked to the edge of the chamber, looking out over his domain. The organized mushroom patches. The stockpiled ore. The systems he had built from chaos.

"Run," he repeated. "Start over. Dig in the mud. Eat rats. Never build anything freely because you're always waiting for someone stronger to take it."

He turned back to them.

"We don't run. We find leverage."

---

Victor sent his sneakiest goblins—two small, quick recruits named Shadow-1 and Shadow-2—to observe Floor Four. Their instructions were specific: *Watch. Do not engage. Do not be seen. Tell me what he does when he thinks he's alone.*

They returned six hours later, shaking and smelling of sulfur, but alive.

"Cow-Man walks," Shadow-1 reported. "Walks in big circle. Round and round."

"Talks to self," Shadow-2 added. "Says old names. Says 'boring.' Says 'too quiet.'"

"Does he eat?" Victor asked.

"Ate big rat. Caught with one hand. Crushed. Then threw away rest."

Victor frowned. "He threw away food?"

"Yes. Looked... sad?" Shadow-1 mimicked a slumped posture. "Not hungry-sad. Just... heavy-sad. Like when goblin finds no shinies for many suns." The goblin shrugged, the concept of a sad Minotaur clearly beyond his pay grade.

Victor dismissed them with a wave and sat on his throne, closing his eyes. The reports were consistent. The "Master" of the fourth floor wasn't hunting. He wasn't foraging. He was existing. 

He was an apex predator without a prey pool. A CEO with an empty office and a telephone that never rang. 

*Loneliness is a significant overhead.*

He activated his skill.

**[Performance Review]**

Target: *Floor Four.*
Filter: *Mental State.*

The familiar blue overlay shimmered into existence, but this time it was distant, fuzzy. Trying to analyze a target through solid rock and three floors of separation was draining.

Then, a ping.

Victor opened his eyes.

> Species: Minotaur (Boss) | Level: 20

*Boredom.*

Of course.

Asterion was immortal, or close enough to it. He was a Level 20 Boss monster stuck on the fourth floor of a beginner dungeon.

He hadn't seen a real challenge in years—decades, maybe. The last significant event was murdering Sir Kael's party fifty years ago.

For fifty years, he had been pacing a stone room, waiting for a fight that never came.

Victor stood up and began to pace, mirroring the beast below.

"He's not hungry," Victor muttered. "He's bored."

If Victor paid the tribute—food, gold, souls—he would just be another weakling. Prey. Something to be farmed until it was exhausted.

If he fought, he would die.

But if he offered something Asterion actually *wanted*...

What does a bored immortal want?

Entertainment. Purpose. Validation.

A worthy opponent.

Victor stopped pacing.

"He doesn't want my goblins," he realized. "They're not a challenge. Killing them would be like me swatting flies. Unsatisfying."

He looked at the iron ore. At the organized farm. At the structure he was building.

"I don't need to pay him tribute. I need to offer him a job."

---

The plan that formed in Victor's mind was insane. By goblin standards, it was suicide. By corporate standards, it was a high-risk merger with a hostile entity.

He drafted the proposal in his head.

*Proposed Terms:*
1. *Victor provides regular "entertainment" (Adventurers).*
2. *Asterion provides security (Defense against high-level threats).*
3. *No tribute payments.*
4. *Mutual non-aggression pact.*

It was solid. It solved Asterion's boredom and Victor's security problem in one move.

There was just one flaw.

To provide adventurers, the dungeon needed adventurers.

And currently, no one knew this dungeon existed. Or rather, the world thought it was empty or looted. Sir Kael's disappearance fifty years ago was the last major event. Since then? Silence.

To feed the Minotaur, Victor needed to ring the dinner bell.

He needed to attract the very people who existed to kill him.

"Sniv."

"Yes, Boss?"

Victor looked at his Chief of Staff. Sniv had grown. He was smarter, stronger, more capable than the trembling creature Victor had met three days ago.

But was he ready for this?

"I need you to do something dangerous."

Sniv puffed out his chest. "Sniv fight rats? Sniv fight new gobs?"

"No. I need you to leave the dungeon."

Sniv froze. His eyes went wide, the pupils expanding until they swallowed the yellow.

"Leave... home?"

"I need you to go to the surface. To the nearest town. I need you to find out where the adventurers are."

"But... humans kill gobs. Humans hate gobs." Sniv was shaking again. "Outside is death."

"Outside is market research," Victor corrected. "And if we don't do it, the Minotaur eats us. Or I accept the tribute, and we all slowly starve."

He put a hand on Sniv's shoulder.

"I'm not sending you to fight. I'm sending you to look. To listen. To be invisible."

"Invisible," Sniv whispered.

"You're the smartest goblin here, Sniv. You're the only one I trust to go out there and come back."

*The only one I trust.*

The words seemed to physically impact the goblin. He stopped shaking. He stood taller, gripping his clipboard like a shield.

"Sniv goes," he said, his voice surprisingly steady. "Sniv looks. Sniv comes back."

"Good." Victor turned back to his throne. "Because if my plan works, we're going to have a lot of company very soon."

And if it didn't work... well, at least Sniv would be outside when the slaughter started.
