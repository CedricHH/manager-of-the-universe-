# Chapter 76: The Franchise Model

Three days post-exhibition.

Victor sat in his office reviewing franchise expansion documents.

Rivercrest dungeon site: 47 kilometers northwest. Population 8,400. Four competing adventure guilds. No dominant market player.

Perfect.

ARMI projected revenue scenarios across eighteen months. The math was clean. The opportunity was obvious.

What wasn't obvious: who would run it.

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Franchise Bidder Analysis] | Status: ACTIVE
> 
> **Bid 1**: Local Adventurer Consortium
> Capital: 3,200 GP | Risk: HIGH | Experience: LOW
> 
> **Bid 2**: Merchant's Guild Subsidiary
> Capital: 12,000 GP | Risk: MODERATE | Victor's ROI: 72%
> 
> **Bid 3**: ANONYMOUS
> Capital: 8,000 GP | Risk: **UNKNOWN** | Victor's ROI: 144%

Victor stared at Bid 3.

Anonymous.

Overfunded.

Suspiciously well-timed.

Either desperation or reconnaissance.

A knock at the door.

Voros entered—grinning.

"You're going to want to hear this."

Victor gestured to the chair. "The anonymous bidder."

Voros laughed. "You already know."

"I know it's suspicious. I don't know *why*."

Voros leaned forward.

"It's **Lady Elara Ravenshield**."

Victor's expression didn't change.

Internally: ARMI cross-referenced the name against forty-three databases.

> **[ARMI]**
> Target: Elara Ravenshield | Status: EXCOMMUNICATED
> Assets Liquidated: Family estate (6,400 GP)
> Outstanding Loans: 1,600 GP (Merchant's Guild, 8% APR)
> **Total Available Capital**: 8,000 GP (100% of net worth)
> 
> Note: 78% probability genuine investment; 22% Church reconnaissance.

Victor processed this.

A Paladin.

Excommunicated.

Investing her *entire life savings* in a dungeon franchise.

"That's either desperation," Victor said slowly, "or a very elaborate trap."

Voros shrugged. "She wants to inspect the dungeon first. 'Moral audit,' she called it."

Victor's fingers tapped the desk.

A moral audit.

From someone the Church had destroyed.

"When?"

"Tomorrow. 10 AM."

Victor nodded. "Schedule it. Maximum transparency."

Voros raised an eyebrow. "You're letting a Paladin audit your dungeon?"

"She's not a Paladin anymore. She's a woman with 8,000 gold pieces and a grudge against the Church."

Victor smiled thinly.

"That makes her useful."

***

**10:04 AM. Next Day.**

Lady Elara Ravenshield entered the dungeon.

Armored.

Skeptical.

Competent.

Victor had seen the type before: True Believers who discovered their institutions were lies.

They either broke or became magnificent.

Elara looked like the latter.

"Lady Ravenshield," Victor greeted, extending a hand.

She didn't take it.

"I'm here to see if your operation is legitimate or exploitation dressed in contracts."

Victor retracted his hand.

"Then let's begin."

***

**The Inspection**

Elara demanded access to everything.

Employee contracts. Living quarters. Financial records. Health benefits documentation.

Victor provided it all.

She examined Sniv's contract first.

"Compensation: 15 gold per month, plus meals, shelter, and dental coverage."

She looked up. "Dental coverage?"

Sniv beamed, showing his newly repaired teeth. "Boss fixed Sniv's fangs! No more pain when eating!"

Elara blinked.

"That's... actually decent."

She moved to Asterion. "And you?"

The Minotaur crossed his arms. "I was bored for two hundred years. Now I have purpose, competitive salary, and performance bonuses. What's your complaint?"

Elara found none.

Zip's contract: Fair wages, healing supplies, voluntary termination clause.

Gorg's contract: Combat bonus structure, rest days, workers' compensation for injuries.

Valerius's contract: Competitive intelligence officer salary, stock options, flexible hours.

She reviewed them all.

Zero legal violations.

Zero slavery clauses.

No debt traps (voluntarily entered debt agreements didn't count).

She looked at Victor, frustrated.

"This is... legal."

"Yes."

"But you're *binding* them. Loyalty mechanics. Psychological dependency."

Victor met her gaze.

"I offer employment. They accept. Consent is contractual."

Elara's jaw tightened. "Consent under survival pressure isn't real consent."

"Then what's your alternative? Let them starve? The Church certainly didn't help them."

Silence.

Because it was true.

The Church *hadn't* helped.

Elara had learned that the hard way.

She exhaled slowly.

"You're better than the alternative. That doesn't make you *good*."

Victor nodded. "I never claimed to be."

***

**The Backstory**

Elara sat across from Victor in the observation room.

She removed her gauntlets.

"You want to know why I'm excommunicated."

"Only if it's relevant to the franchise."

"It is."

She paused.

"I reported corruption. High Priestess Aurelia was embezzling tithes—funds meant for orphanages. I had proof. Documents. Witness testimony."

Victor listened.

"She buried it. Framed me for heresy. Stripped my rank. Blacklisted me across three kingdoms."

Elara's voice was calm, but her hands trembled.

"I lost everything. My title. My family's estate. My *purpose*."

Victor recognized the pattern immediately.

**Betrayed by the institution she served.**

Just like him.

The board. The shareholders. The same story with different nouns.

He didn't say this aloud.

Instead: "You lost everything for principle. That's inefficient."

Elara looked at him sharply. "I'd do it again."

"Then we're opposites. I lost everything for principle *once*. I won't make that mistake again."

Pause.

"But I respect your consistency."

Elara studied him.

"You're not what I expected."

"And you're exactly what I expected," Victor replied. "Someone competent. Someone betrayed. Someone rebuilding."

He leaned forward.

"The question is: do you want to rebuild *with* me, or waste your capital on spite?"

Elara considered this.

***

**The Franchise Agreement**

"I'll invest," Elara said. "With conditions."

Victor gestured for her to continue.

"One: All franchise employees must have voluntary termination clauses. No eternal debt binding."

ARMI calculated: **-8% profit margin.**

"Two: Minimum wage standards above market rate."

**-6% profit margin.**

"Three: Monthly third-party audits. Transparency enforced."

**-4% profit margin.**

**Total Impact: -18% profit margin.**

Victor ran the secondary analysis.

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Ethical Clause Risk/Reward Analysis]
> Profit Impact: -18% | Regulatory Risk: -37% (Total: 28%)
> Status: **APPROVED**
>
> Note: Operational security improvement (+40%) outweighs ROI dilution.

Victor looked up.

"Revised terms accepted."

Elara blinked. "That easily?"

"You're offering insurance against future Church intervention. That has value."

He slid the contract across the desk.

"And you'll be managing Rivercrest. If you believe in the terms, you'll enforce them. That's operationally valuable."

Elara stared at the contract.

Then at Victor.

"You're using my morality as a management tool."

"Yes."

She laughed—bitter, but genuine.

"At least you're honest."

She signed.

> **[ARMI]**
> Balance: 8,000 GP | Transaction: [Partnership Confirmation]
> Cost: 0 GP (Partner Funded) | Status: **APPROVED**
>
> Partnership: Rivercrest Franchise (Lady Elara Ravenshield)
> Equity Split: 60/40 | Launch Timeline: 18 days

Victor stood, extending his hand again.

This time, Elara shook it.

"Welcome to the organization, Lady Ravenshield."

"Just Elara. I'm not a Paladin anymore."

Victor nodded. "Then welcome, Elara."

***

**Evening**

Elara prepared to leave.

She paused at the door.

"Why did you really accept my terms? You could have negotiated harder."

Victor didn't hesitate.

"Because you'll be managing Rivercrest. If you believe in the terms, you'll enforce them consistently. That reduces oversight costs and increases operational trust."

Elara shook her head. "You're using my morality as a management tool."

"I already said yes to that."

"I know. I just can't believe it works."

Victor allowed a thin smile.

"Everything works if you price it correctly."

She left.

Victor returned to his desk.

Franchise expansion roadmap updated:
- **Rivercrest** (18 days) - Elara managing
- **Millhaven** (6 weeks) - TBD
- **Ironpeak** (3 months) - TBD

ARMI flagged new intelligence.

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Threat Assessment] | Status: ALERT
> Surveillance Detected: Church of Eternal Light (Aurelia)
> Vendetta Probability: **94%** | Threat Level: **HIGH**
> 
> Recommendation: Preemptive intelligence gathering on Rivercrest assets.

Victor's expression didn't change.

"Aurelia."

Of course.

The Church wasn't satisfied with the audit stalemate.

And now, with Elara—Aurelia's *former Knight-Commander*—partnering with Victor...

This was personal.

Victor opened his communication interface.

"Voros. I need comprehensive intelligence on Church of Eternal Light asset holdings in Rivercrest. Real estate. Influence networks. Everything."

Voros's reply came within seconds.

*"Anticipated that. Report ready in 6 hours. You're going to war with the Church, aren't you?"*

Victor typed back.

*"No. They're going to war with me. I'm simply responding with superior logistics."*

He closed the interface.

The franchise expansion wasn't just business anymore.

It was the opening move in a conflict Victor didn't start.

**But he would finish.**

***

**STATUS**: Franchise partnership secured with Lady Elara Ravenshield (8,000 GP investment, 60/40 equity split, ethical clauses accepted). Rivercrest launch: 18 days. Church surveillance detected—High Priestess Aurelia escalating personal vendetta. Intelligence gathering initiated. Victor preparing preemptive countermeasures.
