# Chapter 80: The Automation Protocol

The mahogany desk in the administrative office of Dungeon Insolvia was perfectly clear. No stray scrolls, no half-finished ledgers, and certainly no sentimental trinkets. Victor Kaine liked it that way. A clean desk was the mark of a system that functioned without the need for manual interference.

Victor stood by the window, watching the horizon where the towers of Oakhaven were just beginning to catch the morning light. Below him, the dungeon entrance was a hive of activity. Adventurers were filing in for the morning "Ember Trials" bracket, their movements dictated by the new automated queuing system Valerius had installed.

"Efficiency is at an all-time high, Boss," a high-pitched voice said from behind the desk.

Victor turned. Sniv was sitting in the high-backed leather chair. The goblin looked comical—his feet didn't even reach the edge of the seat—but there was a new sharp focus in his yellow eyes. He was wearing his three-piece vest, and his custom-ground spectacles were perched on the bridge of his snout as he scanned a hovering ARMI projection.

"The [Succession Protocol] is processing the final data-handshake, Sniv," Victor said, his voice as clinical as a quarterly earnings report. "How does the seat feel?"

Sniv swallowed hard, his large ears twitching. "It feels... big, Boss. Like there's a lot of weight in the cushions."

"That’s just the gravity of responsibility," Victor noted. "Rule one of management: the chair doesn't make the man, but the man can certainly break the chair if he panics. Are the SOPs integrated?"

Sniv patted a massive, iron-bound tome sitting on the desk. The *Standard Operating Procedures for Dungeon Insolvia*. It was four hundred pages of "In Case of [X], Do [Y]" instructions, covering everything from hero riots to alchemical spills.

"Sniv read them all, Boss! Twice! Even the part about 'Force Majeure' and divine intervention!" The goblin’s chest puffed out. "If a god attacks the dungeon, Sniv files a claim with the Merchant Guild and initiates a tactical retreat to the secondary core."

"Correct," Victor said, nodding slowly. "You don't fight gods, Sniv. You litigate them. You’re learning."

Victor walked over to the desk and placed a hand on the iron-bound book. 

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Promotion / Authorization Upgrade]
> Target: Sniv | New Title: Regional Executive Manager
> Cost: 0 GP | Status: **APPROVED**
> Authority: Full Operational Management (Dungeon & Oakhaven Subsidiaries)

The book glowed with a faint, blue light as the magical binding updated its ownership. Sniv gasped as a pulse of mana traveled up his arm. He wasn't just a goblin anymore; he was a legally recognized extension of Victor Kaine’s administrative will.

"You are now the executive manager of this region," Victor stated. "The Alchemist Guild subsidiary reports to you. The Mercenary Guild training contracts report to you. And Lady Elara will act as your Chief Compliance Officer. If you're unsure of a move, you consult the data. If the data is inconclusive, you ask yourself: 'Does this maximize ROI without increasing legal exposure?'"

"Maximize ROI. Minimize exposure," Sniv repeated like a holy mantra. "Sniv will make you proud, Boss. Sniv will make the ledger bleed gold."

The training grounds were quiet, save for the rhythmic *thud* of a heavy mace hitting a practice dummy. Asterion moved with a grace that belied his massive bulk, his strikes precise and measured. He didn't look like a monster anymore; he looked like a professional athlete at the top of his game.

"You’re leaving," Asterion said, not looking up as Victor approached. It wasn't a question.

"The system is mature," Victor replied. "My presence here has reached the point of diminishing returns. To stay would be to stunt the growth of the organization."

Asterion stopped mid-swing, letting the mace hang low. He turned his head, his bovine eyes reflecting the morning sun. "You spent sixty chapters building this, Victor. You fought the Church, you bankrupted the Guilds, and you bought the very land beneath the city. Now you just... hand the keys to a goblin?"

"I'm not handing the keys," Victor corrected. "I'm delegating the maintenance. My eyes will still be on the dashboard, but Oakhaven is no longer the bottleneck. The real growth is in the Capital."

Asterion let out a huff of air, a tiny cloud of steam escaping his nostrils. "I’ve seen many masters, Victor. Most leave when they’ve lost. You’re the first I’ve seen leave because he’s already won."

"Winning is just another phase of the project," Victor said. He pulled out a small, silver coin—the token of the **Chief Security Officer**. He tossed it to the Minotaur.

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Title Upgrade] | Target: Asterion
> New Role: Chief Security Officer (CSO)
> Mandate: Train autonomous boss entities for franchise expansion.

Asterion caught the coin in a massive palm. He looked at it for a long moment. "Succession planning," he rumbled. "You’ve turned the heroes into customers and the monsters into middle management. I suppose I should be honored."

"Be efficient instead," Victor said. "I’ve left instructions for the expansion into the Northern Territories. Elara will handle the regulatory hurdles, but I need your security forces to ensure the construction sites remain 'secure' from competitor interference."

"The Alchemist Guild ghouls?" Asterion asked with a grim smile.

"Whoever tries to touch the bottom line," Victor said.

In the Grand Hall of the Adventurer Hub, the transition was even more apparent. The blank boards had been replaced by crystalline displays that scrolled through quest listings in real-time. 

Lady Elara Ravenshield stood in the center of the hall, her arms crossed as she watched a group of Gold-rank adventurers sign their new "Independent Contractor Agreements." She wasn't wearing her armor today; she was in a professional, high-collared tunic of deep navy. The scent of incense and old parchment that had defined the Hub for centuries had been replaced by the crisp, cool smell of moisture from the newly installed moss and the faint ozone of mana-based data crystal.

"It’s cleaner," she noted as Victor walked up beside her. "The Hub doesn't feel like a temple anymore. It feels like... an employment agency."

"The distinction is largely semantic," Victor said. "How is the 'Morality Audit' proceeding?"

Elara handed him a ledger. "Sixteen guilds have signed the fair-wage pledge. I’ve flagged three of the mid-tier mercenaries for secondary reviews—they were caught trying to skim the loot bonuses. I’ve initiated the 'Probationary Protocol' you designed."

Victor scanned the data. "Good. Corruption is a friction cost. Keep it under three percent and the system remains stable."

Elara looked at him, her expression unreadable. "You’re really going, aren't you? Voros said a carriage was spotted near the North Gate with a silver seal."

"Oakhaven is an eighty-five thousand gold piece asset," Victor said. "The Royal Capital is a ten-million gold piece market. The choice isn't personal, Elara. It’s mathematical."

"Is it?" Elara asked, her voice softening. "You saved me from the Church. You gave me a way to fight back without losing my soul to their secrets. You think I don't know that’s more than just 'ROI'?"

Victor looked at the adventurers, the hub he now owned, and the woman who was the only one in this world who truly understood the weight of the institutions they had dismantled.

"The best way to honor a gift," Victor said, his voice dropping an octave, "is to ensure it remains profitable. Manage this city well, Elara. Don't let the Church take back the land. If I see a drop in the quarterly reporting, I’ll know you’ve let your principles distract you from the performance."

Elara smiled—a genuine, sharp-edged smile. "I’ll see you in the Capital, Victor. I have a feeling you’re going to need a compliance officer before the year is out."

The carriage arrived at noon. 

It wasn't the gold-and-crimson carriage of Prince Aldric. This was a carriage of obsidian black and polished silver, pulled by four skeletal horses that didn't breathe. The horses moved with a mechanical precision that Victor found instantly appealing.

The door opened, and a man stepped out. He was tall, thin, and wore a suit of grey wool that looked more at home in a London law firm than a fantasy kingdom. He held a monocle to his eye and a briefcase made of seamless, black dragon-leather—an item that hummed with a biometric mana-lock far more sophisticated than Victor’s own baseline leather model.

"Victor Kaine?" the man asked, his voice like the snapping of dry parchment.

"Who’s asking?" Victor replied, his hand resting on the hilt of his cane.

> **[ARMI - RISK ASSESSMENT]**
> Target: Unknown [High Authority]
> Status: ANALYZING...
> Warning: System interface interference detected. High-level Audit Protocol active.

The man adjusted his spectacles and pulled out a card. It was made of pure white jade, etched with a single, black eye.

"I am Thaddeus Vane. Senior Partner at the **Bureau of Imperial Audit**," the man stated. "I have been reviewing your quarterly reports for the Oakhaven district. Your 'Insurance Arbitrage' at Rivercrest was... unconventional."

"It was legal," Victor said.

"Painfully so," Vane agreed, a ghost of a smile touching his thin lips. "The Emperor finds your methods of 'hostile acquisition' through debt-manipulation... intriguing. He has a particular asset in the Northern Territories that is currently 'distressed.' A province that refuses to pay its tithes and has a disturbing habit of executing its tax collectors."

Vane leaned forward, the skeletal horses behind him shifting in unison.

"He wants to know if you can 'reallocate' their loyalty. Or, failing that, if you can liquidate the entire region and turn it into a profitable wasteland."

Victor looked at the jade card, then back at the dungeon he had built from a single goblin and a pile of health potions. 

The system was automated. The staff was trained. The revenue was passive.

"I’m an expensive hire, Mr. Vane," Victor said, his eyes narrowing.

"The Emperor has an open-ended budget for efficiency," Vane replied. "Shall we discuss the signing bonus?"

Victor stepped toward the carriage. The cliffhanger hung in the air: The Dungeon Manager was no longer managing a dungeon. He was going to work for the Empire.

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Job Offer - Imperial Auditor]
> Status: **UNDER REVIEW**
> Note: New Market unlocked: **The Imperial Capital (Act 2)**.
> Balance: 12,450 GP | Potential Signing Bonus: 500,000 GP.

"Sniv," Victor called out without looking back.

"Yes, Boss?" the goblin shouted from the entrance, his eyes wide.

"Keep the moss green. I’ll send for the reports on the first of the month."

Victor entered the carriage. The door clicked shut with a sound of finality. The skeletal horses turned, and with a single, silent command, the carriage vanished into the grey mist of the North.
