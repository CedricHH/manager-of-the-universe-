# Chapter 79: The Severance Package

The Grand Hall of the Oakhaven Adventurer Hub usually smelled of wet leather, cheap ale, and the desperate, metallic tang of unearned glory. Today, it smelled of floor wax and silence.

Victor Kaine stood at the head of the long oak table that had served as the Quest Board’s administrative center for three centuries. He adjusted his silk tie, his reflection in the polished surface of the table clear and cold. Behind him, the massive slate board that usually listed bounties and dungeon raids was blank, save for a single, pulsing blue icon in the top right corner.

> Location: Oakhaven Adventurer Hub | Status: ACQUIRED

"The lighting in here is inefficient," Victor noted, his gaze tracking the flickering magical sconces. "Replace them with low-mana phosphorescent moss by the end of the business day. Sniv, make a note."

"Moss! Yes, Boss!" Sniv chirped from the shadows, scribbling furiously on a clipboard that was almost as large as he was. The goblin was wearing a tiny, custom-tailored vest and spectacles that sat precariously on his green nose. "Low-light, high-yield! Sniv is on it!"

Opposite Victor, the "Board" sat in varying states of psychological collapse. 

Guildmaster Groll looked as though he had aged twenty years in the last twenty-four hours. His expensive silk robes were stained with the soot of the Rivercrest ruins, and his hands trembled as they rested on the table. Beside him, Captain Kael of the Mercenary Guild sat with his arms crossed, his massive war-hammer leaning against the wall—a weapon that was technically now part of a foreclosed inventory.

At the far end sat Arbitrator Valen, the Church’s representative. He was the only one who still looked pristine, his white and gold robes shimmering with holy light, but his eyes were darting toward the exits like a cornered rat.

"This meeting," Victor began, his voice flat and perfectly modulated for a hostile takeover, "is now in session. The agenda is simple: Liquidation or Consolidation."

"You can't do this, Kaine," Kael growled, his voice like grinding gravel. He reached out to grab the handle of his massive war-hammer, but his hand stopped mid-air.

A faint, blue ARMI tag was hovering over the weapon’s head. 

> **[ITEM TAG]**
> Asset ID: MH-882 (Battle-Maul Type A)
> Status: COLLATERAL (FORECLOSED)
> Warning: Unauthorized handling of bank-owned assets is a felony breach of contract.

Kael’s jaw clenched. "You bought some old parchment. That doesn't give you the right to shut down the Hub. The heroes will riot. They'll burn this place to the ground before they let a 'manager' dictate their contracts. My men have worked these lands for generations. They don't report to spreadsheets."

"The 'old parchment' you're referring to," Victor said, sliding a copy of the deed toward the mercenary, "is the primary mortgage of this facility, which was cross-collateralized with the Mercenary Guild’s training grounds. You defaulted on the interest payments five months ago. You also took a predatory short-term loan to upgrade your recruits' gear for the Rivercrest raid—gear that is currently being tagged as bank property."

Victor leaned forward, his eyes locking onto Kael’s.

"As of 12:01 PM, I don't just own the building. I own the Quest Board. And as a matter of policy, I have frozen all payouts until a full forensic audit of your operational expenses is completed."

"You're starving them!" Valen finally spoke, his voice high and thin. "The heroes of the Light are the only thing standing between this city and the wild! If they can't quest, the monsters will overrun the outer districts!"

"The monsters," Victor countered, "are currently my employees. And they are staying strictly within their designated operational zones. The only 'emergency' Oakhaven is facing is a sudden lack of income for people who solve their problems with violence instead of logistics."

He looked at Groll, the Alchemist Guildmaster who hadn't said a word. 

"Groll. Your labs are gone. Your supply chain for violet fire is currently being rerouted to my slime-processing facilities. You are, in every legal and physical sense, a bankrupt entity."

Groll looked up, his yellowed eyes wet with a mixture of hate and despair. "Forty-five years, Kaine. I built that guild from nothing."

"You built it on a monopoly that relied on inefficient pricing and artificial scarcity," Victor said, showing no pity. "You spent your capital on a regulatory raid instead of R&D. You bet on the Church’s administrative power to crush a competitor, rather than improving your own product quality. You lost because you prioritized politics over performance. Now, I’m offering you a severance package."

Victor slid a second set of documents across the table. 

"I am forming a new holding company: **Insolvia Integrated Logistics**. I will absorb the Alchemist Guild and the Mercenary Guild as operational subsidiaries. I cancel your personal debts. I provide you with a fixed salary, a retirement plan, and five percent non-voting equity in the new enterprise."

"In exchange," Victor continued, "you sign a lifelong non-compete clause and hand over all proprietary alchemical recipes and tactical assets. You become department heads. Middle management."

Kael let out a sharp, barking laugh. "Middle management? You want me to lead my men on a leash?"

"I want you to lead them on a payroll," Victor corrected. "A payroll that is guaranteed. Something they currently don't have."

At the mention of payroll, Kael’s anger seemed to hit a wall of cold reality. He knew the mercenaries. He knew they didn't care about "The Light" or "The Guild." They cared about their next meal. And Victor controlled the meal.

"And the Church?" Valen asked, his voice trembling. "High Priestess Aurelia will not stand for this. You are an audit target, Kaine! You are a heretical anomaly!"

"The High Priestess," Victor said, his tone dropping several degrees, "is currently my tenant."

He pulled a final, golden-waxed scroll from his bag. Unlike the others, this one bore the seal of the Royal Land Registry.

"The Cathedral of Light sits on land that was transferred to an 'Urban Development Trust' in 812. The trust language was flawed. It specified that the land could be reclaimed if the 'Public Good' was not being met by the occupants."

Victor looked at Valen with a look of pure, clinical judgment.

"With ninety-four percent hero unemployment and a complete collapse of the local potion market—a collapse *your* audit caused—I have successfully argued in the Merchant Courts that the Church is a public hazard. I am now the trustee."

> Target: Cathedral of Light (Oakhaven) | Status: FILED
> Monthly Rent: 5,000 GP | Arrears: 15,000 GP
> Warning: Eviction potential in 60 days.

Valen gasped, his hand flying to the holy symbol at his chest—a symbol that was also being tagged for its gold content by Victor's peripheral vision. "You're... you're taxing the gods?"

"I'm charging for the land," Victor corrected. "Gods don't need real estate. Institutions do. And your institution is currently occupying five prime acres of central Oakhaven without a valid occupancy permit or a sewage maintenance agreement. I am simply bringing the books into balance."

He reached into his bag and pulled out a map of the city, highlighted in shades of blue. 

"The Urban Development Trust was established during the Great Plague of 812 to ensure that city land was used for 'life-preserving enterprise'. For three hundred years, the Church argued that their prayers met that requirement. However," Victor tapped a graph on the table, "current mortality rates in the outer districts suggests that your 'service' has a failing ROI. The Merchant Courts agree with my assessment: a potion warehouse would preserve more lives than a cathedral that charges tithes for basic healing."

Victor stood up. The meeting was over, and he had a business to run. He didn't wait for a rebuttal. In Victor's world, once the math was settled, the conversation was merely noise.

"You have six hours to sign the merger agreements," Victor said as he gathered his papers. "If you do, you remain relevant. If you don't, I will begin the immediate liquidation of your remaining physical assets. Including your guild halls. Including your personal equipment."

He looked at Valen. "Tell the High Priestess that my door is open. I’m happy to discuss a lease-to-own agreement for her Cathedral. But the interest rates are rising."

As Victor walked toward the exit, his suit jacket catching the light of the phosphorescent moss Sniv was already installing, he paused to look at the blank Quest Board.

"Sniv," he said.

"Yes, Boss?"

"The first quest under the new management starts tomorrow. The objective: **Corporate Restructuring**. The reward: **Job Security**."

The cliffhanger hung in the air like a looming audit: Victor Kaine had not just survived the Dungeon War. He had won the city. And for High Priestess Aurelia, the war was no longer about faith—it was about debt.

> **[ARMI]**
> Current Balance: 12,450 GP (Liquid)
> Projected Monthly Revenue: 185,000 GP (Pre-Tax)
> Status: REGIONAL DOMINANCE ACHIEVED
> Next Phase: **ACT 2 - THE CITY (TRANSITION IN PROGRESS)**

As the Guildmasters stared at the contracts in stunned silence, Victor stepped out into the streets of Oakhaven. The air was cold, the sky was grey, and for the first time, the entire city looked like a single, massive, underperforming asset.

And he was just the man to fix it.
