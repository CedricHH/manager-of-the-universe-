# Chapter 87: The Exit Strategy

The carriage was a marvel of Imperial engineering, which meant it was over-designed, overpriced, and smelled faintly of lavender and tax revenue. The velvet seats were plush enough to swallow a goblin whole, and the suspension utilized gravity-dampening runes that cost more than the average peasant earned in a lifetime.

Victor Kaine sat in the center of this luxury, ignoring the scenic view of the Aethelgardian tundra rolling past the window. His attention was focused entirely on the ledger hovering in his ARMI interface.

"Thaddeus," Victor murmured, tracing a red line down a column of figures. "You predictable, bureaucratic weasel."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Transaction Alert:** [Payout: Spire Garden Liquidation]
> **Gross Yield:** 45,200 GP
> **Status:** **PENDING**
> **Hold:** 6,780 GP (15%) - Reason: [Processing Fee: Hazardous Material Handling]

It was a classic exit scam. Vane knew Victor was leaving jurisdiction. He knew that contesting a fee required filing a Form 88-B in person at the Central Bureau, which was now ten miles behind him. By the time Victor could turn the carriage around, file the paperwork, and argue his case, the "Processing Fee" would have been absorbed into the Bureau's general ledger, vanishing like a coin dropped into a deep well.

"Driver," Victor called out. "Maintain speed. Do not stop."

"Aye, sir!" the driver shouted back, cracking the whip.

Victor leaned back, his eyes narrowing. He couldn't go back. That would be inefficient. It would cost time, and time was now his most expensive currency. He had thirty days to generate a million gold. Spending half a day to recover six thousand was a poor ROI.

Unless he could delegate it.

He tapped the communication crystal embedded in the carriage’s armrest. It was a standard-issue Imperial device, meant for nobles to call ahead to their estates to have the bathwater warmed.

"Dialing," Victor commanded. "Frequency: Aethelgard Bureau, Office 304."

The crystal hummed. Static hissed, then resolved into a voice that sounded like it was vibrating with anxiety.

"Office of... of the Special Project," a voice squeaked. "Silas speaking. Please don't be an auditor."

"Manage your heart rate, Silas," Victor said, his voice crisp. "It's unprofessional."

"Mr. Kaine!" The relief in Silas's voice was audible. "Sir, we—we have a situation. There are men here. Wearing grey. They say they're from the Asset Recovery Division. They want the files. They want the furniture. One of them is measuring the quartz desk."

"Let me guess," Victor said. "They claim they are securing 'State Evidence' related to the mining disaster."

"Yes! They have a warrant signed by a Junior Assistant to the Senior Partner."

"Standard procedure," Victor said. "They are trying to scrub the site. If they take the files, they control the narrative. If they control the narrative, they can justify the 15% fee they just stole from me."

"Stole?" Mina’s voice cut in, sharper and clearer than Silas's. She must have been listening on the extension. "Sir, are you directing us to facilitate a crime?"

"I am directing you to prevent one, Mina. That fee is my capital. And you are my employees. Which means that fee is your salary."

There was a pause. The mention of 'salary' had a way of clarifying moral ambiguities.

"What are your orders, sir?" Mina asked.

"You are no longer temporary hires," Victor said, watching a herd of woolly yaks watch his carriage pass. "As of this moment, you are the Managers of the Aethelgard Branch of *Kaine Consulting*. You have full autonomy. Your objective is simple: Paralyze them."

"We don't have weapons, sir," Silas stammered. "They have wands."

"You have something better, Silas," Victor said, a cold smile touching his lips. "You have the paperwork. Mina, cite Regulation 894-C regarding the transfer of hazardous volatility data. Silas, calculate the liability risk of moving files contaminated by Gold Toxicity without a Class-5 containment unit. Do not let them touch a single piece of paper until they have filled out the requisitions in triplicate."

"Bureaucracy," Mina whispered. She sounded like a pyromaniac who had just been handed a torch.

"Weaponize it," Victor commanded. "I'll stay on the line."

**[The Aethelgard Bureau - Office 304]**

Agent Kaelen of the Asset Recovery Division was used to fear. When he walked into an office, clerks usually scattered. Junior analysts wept. Even managers would start sweating as they tried to hide their illicit ledgers.

He was not used to a small woman with dark circles under her eyes blocking his path with a clipboard.

"Move aside," Kaelen barked, motioning for his two enforcers to advance. "We are seizing this office by order of the Senior Partner."

"I see the order," Mina said, her voice flat and monotone. She peered at the scroll in Kaelen's hand. "However, this is a Standard Seizure Order, Form 12-A. You are attempting to seize assets related to a Kinetic Mama Event."

"So?"

"So," Mina pushed her glasses up her nose. "Regulation 894-C clearly states that 'Evidence possessing a residual mana volatility of nearly 12% Gold Toxicity must be handled by a certified Hazardous Materials team.' Are you certified, Agent?"

Kaelen blinked. "What? It's paper. Paper isn't volatile."

"The ink was wet when the event occurred," Silas piped up from behind a stack of files. He was trembling, but he held a massive ledger like a shield. "The, uh, particulate matter in the air... it bonded with the cellulose. If you move these files without a Class-5 shielded box, the static electricity from your wool coat could trigger a secondary sub-critical detonation."

Kaelen looked down at his grey wool coat. He took a half-step back.

"That's ridiculous," Kaelen sneered. "I've never heard of such a regulation."

"Ignorance of the safety code is a Tier 3 violation," Mina said, scribbling furiously on her clipboard. "I'm logging this interaction. 'Agent displayed reckless disregard for public safety within a blast zone...'."

"Stop writing!" Kaelen snapped. "I am taking this desk."

"The quartz desk?" Silas squeaked. "Oh, gods. Sir, that desk was the epicenter of the Authority conduction! It’s practically a mana-battery now. If you touch it with ungrounded gloves, you could be liquified. Just like the Governor."

The two enforcers behind Kaelen exchanged a look. They slowly lowered the quartz desk they had been about to lift.

"I... I will call your bluff," Kaelen snarled, though he didn't move forward. "I am checking with the Senior Partner."

"Please do," Mina said. "And while you are at it, ask him about the 'Processing Fee' attached to the Kaine Account. Because if these assets are too dangerous to move, then the 'handling' service hasn't been performed. Charging for unperformed services is fraud, Agent. Imperial fraud."

Kaelen’s face went red. He knew about the fee. It was the department bonus pool for the quarter.

"You are obstructing Imperial Justice," Kaelen hissed.

"No," Victor’s voice amplified from the communication crystal sitting on the (allegedly radioactive) desk. "They are conducting a Compliance Audit. And you are failing it."

Kaelen jumped. He looked at the glowing crystal. "Kaine? You're gone. You have no authority here."

"I am a Consultant," Victor’s voice was smooth, distorted by the static but unmistakable in its arrogance. "And my employees are enforcing the terms of my contract. Release the hold on my funds, Agent. Or Mina will file that safety violation report. I imagine Thaddeus Vane would be very displeased to hear his team risked blowing up the Bureau because they didn't read the manual."

Kaelen looked at Mina’s pen, poised over the 'Submit' rune on her clipboard.
He looked at Silas, who was nodding frantically behind his ledger.
He looked at the 15% bonus he was trying to protect.

"Fine," Kaelen spat. He pulled a stamp from his belt and slammed it onto the transfer order in his hand. "Release the funds. But we're taking the chair. It's wood. It doesn't conduct mana."

"Accepted," Victor’s voice came through. "Silas, give him the chair. It has a squeaky wheel anyway."

**[The Carriage]**

> **[ARMI]**
> **Update:** Fund Hold Released.
> **Adjustment:** +6,780 GP
> **Total Liquid Assets:** 64,230 GP

Victor let out a long breath. He tapped the crystal again.

"Well done," he said. "Mina, Silas. You passed."

"I think I'm going to throw up," Silas's voice came through, tiny and tinny.

"That is a natural physiological reaction to successful negotiation," Victor assured him. "Now, listen carefully. Keep the office. Don't let them in. I am wiring you an operating budget of 500 GP. You are my eyes and ears in the North. If Vane sneezes, I want to know the velocity."

"Sir," Mina asked. "Are we... are we really a Branch?"

"You are until you stop being profitable," Victor said. "Kaine Consulting, North. Create a logo. Make it sharp. Kaine out."

He severed the connection.

Victor looked at the ledger again. 64,000 Gold. It was a start. A massive fortune by any normal standard, enough to buy a small barony.

But compared to a million? It was pocket change. It was 6.4%.

"I need higer yields," Victor whispered to the empty carriage. "I need scale."

The carriage began to slow down.

Victor frowned. He checked the time. They shouldn't be stopping. They were still miles from the border crossing at the Ice-Tooth Pass.

"Driver?" Victor called out. "Why are we losing momentum?"

"Blockade, sir!" the driver shouted back. "Road's closed!"

Victor sighed. He closed the ledger and adjusted his cuffs. Of course the road was closed. The universe hated efficiency.

He opened the carriage door and stepped out into the biting wind of the tundra.

Ahead, the road was blocked not by soldiers, or bandits, or a fallen tree.

It was blocked by a single, massive wagon heavily reinforced with iron plates. It was painted widely with garish colors—purple and gold—and displayed a oversized sign that read:

**THE GILDED CARAVAN - TRAVELING EMPORIUM**
*Authorized Reseller of Generic Adventure Supplies*

Standing in front of the wagon was a man who looked like he had been assembled entirely from spare parts of other, sleeker men. He wore a patchwork coat of mismatched furs, a hat that was too tall for utility, and a smile that had too many teeth.

"Hail, traveler!" the man shouted, spreading his arms wide. "The pass is closed! Avalanche risk! Terrible tragedy! But fear not! While you wait for the snow to clear—which could take days, really, just days—why not browse my wares? I have potions! I have rations! I have blankets priced competitively given the sudden supply shock!"

Victor stared at the man. He activated [Performance Review].

> **[ARMI]**
> **Target:** Barnaby 'The Leech'
> **Class:** Merchant (Level 12)
> **Skill:** [Price Gouging], [Artificial Scarcity]
> **Net Worth:** 4,500 GP

The man wasn't just a merchant. He was a scalper. He was blocking the road to create a captive market.

Victor felt the irritation in his chest recede, replaced by a warm familiarity.

"Price gouging," Victor said, stepping onto the frozen mud. "Artificial scarcity. Monopoly on transit."

"I prefer 'Strategic Positioning'," Barnaby beamed. "Entrance to the browsing area is a mere 5 silver."

Victor smiled. It wasn't a nice smile.

"Driver," Victor said, not looking back. "Run it over."

"Sir?"

"If that wagon is blocking the Imperial Highway, it is an obstruction. If it is an authorized shop, it is subject to zoning laws. Either way," Victor buttoned his jacket. "I am about to liquidate a competitor."

He walked forward.

"Barnaby, was it?" Victor called out, his voice carrying over the wind. "I'm looking to make an acquisition. How much for the wagon?"

Barnaby laughed. "It's not for sale, friend! This is my livelihood! My legacy!"

"Everything is for sale," Victor said, checking his toxicity levels. "It's just a question of whether you sell it... or I foreclose on it."
