# Chapter 17: The Proposal

The air tasted of copper and ancient dust. A cocktail of stagnation coating the back of Victor's throat.

Victor Kaine sat on a broken pillar, one leg crossed over the other, adjusting the cuffs of his suit. The fabric was torn at the elbow, a casualty of his descent, but he smoothed it with the reverence of a man preparing for a board meeting. In this world of monsters and magic, presentation was the only currency he had left that didn't depreciate.

Opposite him stood the asset in question, Asterion.

The Minotaur was a mountain of muscle and matted fur, standing easily nine feet tall. His double-bladed axe rested on the stone floor, the head buried inches deep in the granite. His bovine eyes were fixed on the vaulted ceiling, tracing cracks where roots bled through the stone.

"Tell me your plan," Asterion rumbled, his voice tectonic. "And I'll decide whether to eat you or listen."

Victor cleared his throat, checking his internal interface.

"This dungeon is a failing business," Victor began, his voice steady. "You are operating at a hundred percent loss. No adventurers. No loot cycle. No purpose. You are the final boss of... nothing."

Asterion huffed, a sound like steam escaping a pressure valve. "I was placed here by the gods," the Minotaur said, his voice heavy with centuries of rote repetition. "To guard the temple. To test the worthy." He gestured vaguely at the ruins. "The temple is rubble. The gods have been silent for an age. I guard **nothing**."

"Exactly," Victor said, leaning forward. "You are structurally redundant. In the corporate world, we would typically liquidate the asset. Strip the copper, sell the land, and move on."

Asterion finally looked at him. "You suggest I leave? My bind is to this stone, little goblin-master. I cannot leave."

"I'm not suggesting you leave," Victor corrected. "I'm suggesting you rebrand. Stop guarding. Start **hunting**."

The Minotaur’s brow furrowed. "Hunting?"

"I will bring adventurers to you," Victor promised. "Not lost strays. Real challengers. People who want to kill you for glory, for unique drops, for the story. I will bring you the 'worthy' test you were built for."

Asterion shifted, pulling his axe from the stone with a screech. "And why would they come? The world has forgotten this place."

"Because I will make them remember," Victor said. "I will create a narrative. A lure. Supply and demand, Asterion. Right now, supply is high—you're here, ready to fight. Demand is zero. My job is to manufacture demand."

"And what is the price?" Asterion asked, studying Victor with a keen, predator's intelligence. "You do not strike me as a creature of charity. You smell of... calculation."

"I get a deterrent," Victor said bluntly. "I can handle the logistics. I can manage the goblins. I can build the traps. But I cannot stop a high-level threat. That’s your job. You protect the integrity of the dungeon from threats that exceed my pay grade. You become the nuclear option."

"Nuclear?"

"The ultimate stick," Victor clarified. "Big weapon. Lots of damage. The thing that keeps the neighbors polite."

Asterion laughed, a dry, hacking sound. "You think I will serve a goblin-master? A weakling who talks because he cannot fight? I could crush you now, Manager. I could paint this room with you and go back to my sleep."

"You could," Victor agreed, not flinching. "And then you would return to your silence. You would stand here for another hundred years, watching the dust settle, until your axe rusts to nothing and your name is forgotten. Is that the specific type of hell you're looking for?"

The Minotaur went still. The silence stretched, heavy and suffocating. Victor held his breath, betting everything on the creature’s pride—on the universal fear of irrelevance.

"Words," Asterion spat, though the anger had lost its edge. "Words are wind. Prove your worth."

He lifted the axe. For a split second, Victor saw his death. The analytics flashed red.
> **[ARMI]**
> **Alert**: Lethal Threat Detected.
> **Evasion Chance**: 0.0001%
> **Note**: Negotiation is the only viable path to survival.

But the axe didn't fall. Asterion pointed the haft at Victor, a gesture of challenge.

"Bring me a worthy opponent within one month," the Minotaur commanded. "Someone who can actually make me sweat. Someone who knows the old forms of combat. Fail, and I burn your little empire to the ground. I will start with your goblins, I will destroy your traps, and I will end with you."

The air between them shimmered, the magic of the dungeon responding to the vow.
> **[ARMI]**
> **Contract Triggered**: [The Guardian's Pact]
> **Party A**: Victor Kaine (Manager)
> **Party B**: Asterion (Guardian/Final Boss)
> **Terms**: Deliver "Worthy Opponent" (Level 15+)
> **Deadline**: 30 Days
> **Penalty**: [Total Liquidation] (Death)
> **Status:** AWAITING CONFIRMATION

Victor stood up, his legs like jelly, but he locked his knees. He brushed invisible lint from his lapel.

"Thirty days," Victor repeated. "A generous timeline. I'll have the quarterly projections ready before then."

He extended his hand.

Asterion stared at the small, pale appendage. "Human custom? Goblins do not do this. They grovel."

"It's a contract," Victor said, holding his gaze. "A promise. In my world, a handshake is more binding than blood. It’s professional courtesy."

Asterion hesitated. Slowly, he reached out. His hand was the size of a shovel, rough like bark.

He engulfed Victor's hand. He could have crushed the bones to powder. Instead, he squeezed—a firm, acknowledging pressure.

"One month, Manager," Asterion rumbled. "Do not disappoint me."

***

The climb back was brutal—each stair cut for giants, leaving Victor wheezing by the top, suit soaked with sweat.

Sniv was waiting by the archway, practically vibrating with anxiety. The little goblin had chewed his fingernails down to the quick.

"Boss!" Sniv shrieked when he saw Victor emerge. He hopped from foot to foot, ears flapping. "Boss alive! Boss not eaten! Sniv... Sniv thought you were snack! Sniv was preparing speech for new boss!"

"Loyal as ever, Sniv," Victor wheezed, leaning against the cool stone wall. "Cancel the funeral. We’re still in business."

Current Status check:
> **[ARMI]**
> **Biometrics Update**: Stamina 14/50 (Exhausted) | Stress: Critical
> **Status**: Successfully Disengaged from High-Threat Entity.

Victor pushed himself off the wall and walked past the goblin, heading for the central chamber he had commandeered as his office. He collapsed onto the stone seat he called a throne, the cold rock seeping through his trousers.

He had bought time. That was all it was. A thirty-day extension on his execution. In the corporate world, thirty days was a lifetime. You could launch a product, crash a stock, or rebrand a company in thirty days.

But he wasn't in the corporate world. He was in a hole in the ground.

"Sniv," Victor said, his voice rasping.

"Yes, Boss? Water? Beetle snack?"

"No beetles," Victor said, suppressing a shudder. "I need a status report. What are our liquid assets?"

Sniv blinked. "Liquid?"

"Money, Sniv. Gold. Shinies. What do we have?"

Sniv rummaged in a pouch at his belt and produced three copper coins and a button. "Goblins found these in old pit. Shiny."

Victor stared at the pitiful pile. Three copper. Approximately zero purchasing power.

"We have thirty days," Victor said, mostly to himself. He looked at the map he had scratched into the dirt floor earlier. It showed the dungeon's location relative to the forest and the road. The road led to Oakhaven, the nearest hub of civilization.

That was where the customers were.

"Get me a map," Victor ordered, sitting up straighter. The fatigue was still there, but the mind was beginning to spin up. The gears of strategy were turning. "Detailed. Every road, every trail to Oakhaven. And I need materials. Wood. Charcoal. Whatever we can use to make signs."

Sniv tilted his head. "Signs? For... 'Do Not Enter'?"

"No," Victor said, a predatory smile touching his lips. It was the smile he used to wear when acquiring a competitor for pennies on the dollar. "For the opposite. If we want a worthy opponent, Sniv, we can't just wait for them to stumble in. The market is saturated with distraction. We need to cut through the noise."

He picked up one of the copper coins and flipped it. It caught the torchlight, glimmering dully.

"We're going to advertise," Victor declared.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Mission Updated**: [The Headhunt]
> **Objective**: Lure High-Level Party (Level 15+)
> **Time Remaining**: 29 Days, 23 Hours
> **Budget**: 3 Copper | 1 Button
> **Projected Success Rate**: < 1%

Victor looked at the holographic display floating in his peripheral vision. The odds were insults. He had built empires on worse odds.

"Sniv," Victor added. "Gather the others. We're having a staff meeting. Agenda item one: how to lie to heroes."

Sniv grinned, exposing a row of jagged, yellow teeth. "Sniv likes lying."

"I know," Victor said. "That's why you're middle management."

This was his mess. And he was going to fix it.

Step one: Find a hero.
Step two: Try not to get killed by him.

"Let's get to work," Victor whispered.
