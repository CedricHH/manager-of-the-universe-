# Chapter 88: The Return Investment

The wind on the Imperial Highway didn't just blow; it bit. It was a freezing, howling gale that carried the scent of pine needles and impending extortion.

Victor Kaine stood in the mud, staring up at the blockade.

The "avalanche" that blocked the pass was impressive. It was a twenty-foot wall of snow and ice, piled perfectly across the narrowest choke-point of the canyon. It was white, pristine, and entirely impossible.

"It rained yesterday," Victor noted, tapping his notebook. "The ambient temperature was four degrees above freezing. Snow shouldn't have accumulated. It should have melted."

"Climate change!" Barnaby shouted from atop his colorful wagon. The scalper was leaning against a sign that read *THE GILDED CARAVAN: PREMIUM WAITING ROOM - 10 GP/HOUR*. "Terrible business, the weather. Very unpredictable! That's why I sell these heated blankets for fifty gold. Supply and demand, friend!"

Victor looked at the merchant. Barnaby 'The Leech' was a chaotic collection of patches and pockets, wearing a hat that looked like it had swallowed a smaller hat. His smile was wide, fixed, and didn't reach his eyes—the eyes of a man calculating exactly how much gold he could extract from a desperate traveler.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Target Analysis:** [Barnaby]
> **Active Skill:** [Artificial Scarcity] (Rank C)
> **Mana Signature:** Earth/Ice Hybrid (Detected in the snow wall).
> **Conclusion:** The obstruction is a manufactured asset.

"You built the wall," Victor said. It wasn't an accusation; it was a line item audit.

Barnaby feigned shock, pressing a hand to his patchwork chest. "Slander! I am a humble provider of services! I merely... positioned myself to assist those impacted by this natural tragedy."

"The snow is packed with mana," Victor continued, stepping closer. "Ice-structuring runes. Low grade, probably bought from a failed apprentice. You didn't clear the road because the road *is* your inventory."

Barnaby’s smile faltered for a fraction of a second, then returned, sharper this time. Disdainful.

"And if I did?" Barnaby leaned down, his voice dropping the friendly merchant,pitch. "The nearest Imperial guard is twenty miles back. The pass is closed. You can pay my 'Priority Bypass Fee' of five hundred gold, or you can freeze. Those are your market options."

Victor checked his watch. "Five hundred gold. That's a 400% markup on standard toll rates."

"I call it a 'Convenience Tax'."

"I see." Victor closed his notebook. "You're not a merchant, Barnaby. You're a toll booth with a personality disorder. And you're delaying my acquisition schedule."

Victor raised his hand.

"Driver," he called back to his rental carriage. "You're dismissed."

The driver blinked, shivering on his bench. "Sir? You're staying here? In the snow?"

"I'm upgrading my transport," Victor said. "Go back to Aethelgard. Tell Vane I said the roads need paving."

He tossed the driver a final pouch of coins. The man didn't hesitate; he cracked the reins, turning the horses around and fleeing the freezing pass.

Barnaby watched the carriage leave, confusing clouding his face. "You sent your ride away? Bold strategy. Now the heated blankets are *one hundred* gold."

"I don't want a blanket," Victor said, walking toward the painted wagon. "I want to talk about your business license."

"I have a permit!" Barnaby reached into his coat.

"Not that license," Victor corrected. "I mean your *existence* license. The one that keeps you out of an Imperial dungeon for obstructing a military highway."

Barnaby scoffed. He pulled a short wand from his belt—polished driftwood topped with a raw mana crystal. "You talk a lot for a man standing in the cold. Maybe you need to cool off."

He waved the wand. The snow wall behind him groaned. A chunk of ice the size of a barrel detached itself and hovered, aiming directly at Victor's chest.

"Price negotiation is over," Barnaby sneered. "Pay the toll, or become part of the pavement."

Victor didn't flinch. He didn't even draw a weapon. He simply activated `[Authority]`.

> **[System Alert]**
> **Mode:** Hostile Takeover
> **Target:** 'The Gilded Caravan' (Business Entity)
> **Leverage:** Regulatory Non-Compliance (Road Blockage)

"Barnaby," Victor said, his voice amplified by the cold mana of the pass. "You are making a classic error. You are confusing *leverage* with *power*. That ice block is power. But this..."

Victor pointed a finger at the wagon itself.

"...This is leverage."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Skill:** [Asset Liquidation] (Targeted)
> **Target:** Wagon Axle (Left-Rear)
> **Cost:** 50 MP

Victor snapped his fingers.

There was no explosion. Just a sharp, metallic *crack*. The rear axle of the massive, painted wagon sheared cleanly in half.

The wagon lurched. The right side collapsed into the mud with a groan of stressed timber. The sudden tilt sent Barnaby stumbling, his concentration breaking. The hovering ice block fell harmlessly into the snowbank with a dull thud.

"My stock!" Barnaby shrieked, sliding down the slanted roof of his shop. "My inventory! That axle was reinforced ironwood! That's impossible!"

"Nothing is impossible," Victor said, walking calmly to the fallen merchant. "Just expensive. That was a structural audit. You failed."

Barnaby scrambled to his feet, raising his wand again, but Victor was already there. He didn't strike the man. He slapped a piece of paper onto Barnaby's chest.

It wasn't a spell. It was a contract.

"What is this?" Barnaby stammered, looking down at the glowing glyphs burning onto the parchment.

"A Purchase Agreement," Victor said. "I am acquiring 'The Gilded Caravan' and all its assets. Including the snow wall. Including the wand. And including you."

"Me? I'm not for sale!"

"You just attacked a Consultant of the Galactic Audit Consortium," Victor lied smoothly. "Technically, that makes you an enemy combatant. I can liquidate you right now. Turn your mana into coins and leave your body for the wolves."

Victor’s eyes flashed with gold toxicity. The threat wasn't a bluff. Barnaby saw it. He saw the cold, mathematical calculation in Victor's gaze.

"Or," Victor continued, his voice softening back to a boardroom calm. "You can accept the position of 'Head of Logistics' for Kaine Consulting. You keep 5% of your sales. You drive the wagon. And you clear that wall. Right now."

Barnaby looked at the broken wagon. He looked at the contract. He looked at the wolves beginning to howl in the distance.

"Ten percent," Barnaby whispered, his negotiator instincts twitching even in defeat.

"Two percent," Victor countered instantly. "And dental."

Barnaby slumped. "Done."

He pressed his thumb to the paper.

**[Inside The Gilded Caravan - 20 Minutes Later]**

The wagon was bigger on the inside. Much bigger.

Victor stepped through the crooked door and found himself in a space that defied Euclidean geometry. It was a long, narrow warehouse lined with shelves that stretched up into a shadowy ceiling. It smelled of spices, old paper, and ozone.

"Spatial expansion runes," Victor murmured, running a hand along a shelf stocked with 'Dragon-Repellent Spray' (which was just vinegar). "Stolen military tech?"

"Surplus!" Barnaby called out from the driver’s seat outside. The wagon had been miraculously repaired—apparently, the 'Head of Logistics' had a few mending scrolls stashed away. " bought at auction! Legitimate salvage!"

"Lies," Victor muttered, but he smiled. The wagon was a mobile base. It had a desk. It had a bed. It had inventory space.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Asset Acquired:** [The Gilded Caravan] (Rank B Vehicle)
> **Current Assets:** 64,230 GP
> **Projected Travel Time to Oakhaven:** 4 Days (Reduced from 12).

"Move us out, Barnaby!" Victor commanded, settling into the leather chair at the desk. "And bring down that wall. We have a deadline."

Outside, there was a rumble of earth magic as the snow wall dissolved. The wagon lurched forward, gaining speed with unnatural smoothness.

Victor opened his ledger. Four days to Oakhaven. Then the real work began.

He was about to close the book when a chime echoed through his head. It wasn't the ARMI notification. It was deeper, resonating in his teeth.

He pulled the obsidian card—the Consortium Contract—from his pocket. It was pulsing.

> **[System Alert]**
> **Feature Unlocked:** [The Galactic Exchange]
> **Status:** Online.
> **Signal Strength:** 14% (Weak).

Victor placed the card on the desk. A hologram flickered to life above it. It was a scrolling ticker of green and red numbers, projecting a 3D marketplace into the air.

But it wasn't selling stocks.

*   **PRAYER FUTURES (Zeus-Sector)**: DOWN 4.2%
*   **SOUL FRAGMENTS (Pure)**: UP 1.8%
*   **PLANETARY CORES (Used)**: STABLE

Victor stared. It was a stock market for reality itself. Gods, demons, and cosmic entities trading resources across dimensions.

And then, he saw a listing.

> **Listing #894-Alpha**
> **Seller:** Entity 'The Broken King' (World 44-Z)
> **Item:** [Miracle: Rain] (Draft Quality)
> **Price:** 5,000 GP
> **Note:** "Need quick cash for army. Will trade for Mana."

Victor froze. 5,000 GP for a literal miracle?

On Earth, water rights were valuable. In a drought-stricken world, they were priceless.

"Barnaby!" Victor shouted. "Do we have any mana potions left?"

"Two crates!" Barnaby yelled back. "Why? Are you thirsty?"

"No," Victor whispered, watching the ticker scroll. "I'm investing."

He looked at the number: **1,000,000 GP**.

It had seemed impossible an hour ago. Now, looking at the Exchange, he saw the path. He didn't just have to liquidate assets on Terra-Insolvia.

He could arbitrage the universe.

"Drive faster, Barnaby," Victor said, a predatory light igniting in his eyes. "I think I just found a supplier."
