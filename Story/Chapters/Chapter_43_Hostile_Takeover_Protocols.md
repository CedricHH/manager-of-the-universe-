# Chapter 43: Hostile Takeover Protocols

The transition from "legitimate business trip" to "tactical retreat" was seamless, largely because Victor planned his commutes like military operations.

They reached the forest edge by midnight. The carriage—hired under a shell company name—dropped them off three miles from the actual entrance. Victor led Kael and Mira through the underbrush, navigating by ARMI coordinates rather than landmarks.

"You're quiet," Victor said, not looking back.

"We're processing," Mira replied. Her staff was glowing, illuminating the path. "You walked into the Alchemist Guild, insulted the Guildmaster, and declared war. Most merchants would be hyperventilating."

"Panic is a resource leak," Victor said. "It consumes energy and yields no solutions."

He stopped at a seemingly solid rock face. A heavy vine curtain obscured the entrance.

"Zip," Victor called out. "Authentication: Epsilon-Nine."

The rock groaned. An illusion shimmering faded, revealing a dark tunnel reinforced with stone brick.

Zip popped his head out. "Boss! You’re back! Did we sell? Did we get the gold?"

"We got the gold," Victor said. "And we got a war. Assemble the board. Core Room. Ten minutes."

Zip’s eyes went wide. "Processing!" He vanished into the dark.

Victor stepped inside. Kael and Mira hesitated.

"This," Kael murmured, touching the stonework. "This isn't a mine. The mana density..."

"This is a Dungeon," Mira whispered. She looked at Victor's back with a mix of horror and professional awe. "He's not a merchant. He's a Dungeon Lord."

Victor paused. He turned to face them. The ambient mana of the tunnel illuminated his face, casting sharp shadows.

"I am an Asset Manager," he corrected. "This facility is my primary asset. And right now, it is under threat of hostile acquisition."

He held their gaze.

"You have two choices. One: I pay out your contracts now, with a 20% severance bonus, and you walk away. You claim ignorance. You live."

Kael looked at the tunnel deeper in. "And the second choice?"

"Two: You sign an amended contract for 'Critical Infrastructure Defense'. Triple hazard pay. 0.5% equity vesting over three years." Victor tapped his document case. "You become shareholders in this operation."

Kael hesitated. He looked at the stonework, then at Victor. "Victor... you know what the Kingdom says about Dungeon Lords. We're taught you're monsters. That you feed on humans."

"Do I look like I'm feeding?" Victor asked.

"No. But you're enemies of humanity. By law."

"The Alchemist Guild poisons half the city with diluted potions to keep prices high," Victor countered, his voice steady. "The Merchant Guild ruins families who don't pay protection fees. The King taxes farmers into starvation to fund border wars."

Victor stepped closer.

"They are the 'heroes', Kael. I am just a business owner who refuses to be regulated by hypocrites. I don't feed on humans. I feed on inefficiency. I provide a service. My dungeon provides goods. And I treat my employees better than any Guildmaster in Oakhaven."

Mira looked at her staff, then at the tunnel. "He has a point, Kael. The Guild pays us in copper and treats us like arrow-fodder. Victor pays in gold and offers equity."

"It's treason," Kael muttered. But his hand hadn't left his sword.

"It's a paradigm shift," Victor said. "History is written by the winners. And winners are just the ones with the best budget management."

Kael smirked. A slow, dangerous smile. He adjusted his sword belt. "And triple hazard pay?"

"And full dental," Victor added. "If we survive."

"I never liked the Alchemist Guild anyway. Their potions taste like piss." Kael stepped forward. "I'm in."

Mira sighed, but she stepped into the tunnel beside him. "0.5% equity of a Dungeon could make me richer than a Baroness. I'm in. But if I die, I'm haunting you."

"Noted," Victor said. "HR will process the paperwork later. Move."

The Core Room was the heart of the operation—literally and metaphorically.

Nova, the Dungeon Core, pulsed with a steady blue rhythm in the center. Floating screens of light displayed mana levels, floor integrity, and spawn rates.

Asterion stood by the wall, massive arms crossed. The minotaur looked less like a monster and more like a weary security chief who had just been woken up for a false alarm.

"It is not a false alarm," Victor said, reading the minotaur's body language.

"I didn't say anything," Asterion rumbled.

"You were projecting," Victor said. He tapped the central table—a slab of stone Nova had grown for him. "Situation Report: Guildmaster Groll knows. He has identified me as the operator of this facility. He threatened exposure to the Crown unless I surrender the asset."

Sniv gasped. "Surrender? Give Nova to... the bad alchemist?"

Nova pulsed red. an angry, dissonant hum filled the room.

"Denied," Victor said. "I refused. Which means Groll will move to the next phase: Forced Liquidation."

"He'll send the Army?" Kael asked, looking around the room nervously.

"Not yet," Victor said. "If he tells the King, the King takes the dungeon. Groll wants it for himself. He needs to seize it privately. That means mercenaries. Off-the-books wetwork teams."

Victor pulled up a holographic display via ARMI, projecting it over the table.

"Our current defenses are designed for 'Adventure Tourism'. Non-lethal traps, telegraphed attacks, safe rooms. That ends tonight."

He looked at Nova.

"Initiate Protocol: Fortress."

> **[ARMI - DUNGEON MANAGEMENT]**
> Mode Switching: Enterprise -> Defense
> Restrictions: LIFTED
> Lethality Protocols: ACTIVE
> Budget Available: 850 GP (Liquid)

"Nova," Victor commanded. "Unlock the Tier 2 Trap menu. I want the 'Acid Pit' upgrade for the slime floor. And the 'Crushing Walls' for the corridor."

"That's expensive," Asterion grunted. "Mana cost is high."

"I'm injecting capital," Victor said. He opened a heavy pouch and poured gold coins directly onto the Core's pedestal.

The gold dissolved into light, absorbed instantly by the system.

> **[SYSTEM NOTICE]**
> Deposit Accepted: 800 GP
> Mana Converion: COMPLETE
> Construction Queue: Accelerated

"What about manpower?" Kael asked. "Goblins and one minotaur against a mercenary company?"

"We don't fight fair," Victor said. "We fight effectively. Sniv?"

The goblin jumped. "Yes, Boss!"

"The potion slimes. Change their diet."

Sniv blinked. "Diet? No berries?"

"Feed them the alchemical waste runoff," Victor said. "The toxic byproducts we usually filter out. We need them volatile."

"They'll turn green," Sniv warned. "Acidic. They melt boots."

"Perfect," Victor said. "Position them in the ventilation shafts of Floor 1."

He turned to his new employees.

"Kael, you're Field Commander. Asterion is CEO of Defense, you report to him. Take the goblins. Teach them shield walls. I don't need them to kill; I need them to delay."

"Delay for what?" Kael asked.

"For the market to react," Victor said.

He pulled out a sheet of parchment.

"Mira, you're with me. We're drafting letters."

"Letters?" Mira asked incredulously. "An army is coming, and we're writing mail?"

"We are writing leverage," Victor corrected.

He began to write.

*To Lord Sterling:*
*Per Article 4 of our Partnership Agreement (Mutual Defense), I am formally notifying you of an imminent hostile incursion on our shared asset. The Alchemist Guild is attempting an illegal seizure. I require your private security forces to secure the perimeter. In exchange, I am prepared to increase your equity share by 5%.*
*Time is of the essence. Protect your investment.*

"Zip," Victor commanded. "Run this to Sterling Manor. Use the secret tunnels. Do not be seen."

"On it!" Zip grabbed the scroll and bolted.

Victor started a second letter.

*To Councilor Elena Cross:*
*Warning: Significant market volatility expected. The Alchemist Guild is engaging in unsanctioned paramilitary operations near Oakhaven. Expect disruption to potion supplies. As my partner, I advise you to short-sell Alchemist Guild stock immediately.*

"Why tell her?" Mira asked. "She can't stop Groll."

"No," Victor agreed. "But she can make it expensive for him. Groll cares about profit. If his war starts costing him his stock value, he'll hesitate."

Dawn brought gray light and silence to the forest.

Victor stood in the control room, watching the external projection screens. The forest looked peaceful. Birds sang.

"Movement," Asterion rumbled.

He pointed to Sector 4.

Shadows detached themselves from the trees. Men in matte-black armor. No heraldry. No banners. Just silent, professional movement.

> **[ARMI - THREAT SCAN]**
> Target ID: Unknown Mercenary Group
> Likely Identity: "The Black Talons" (Groll's private enforcement arm)
> Count: 40 Units
> Average Level: 15-18
> Equipment: High-grade alchemical explosives, anti-magic dampeners.

"Black Talons," Kael hissed. "They're bad news, Victor. They don't take prisoners. They burn entire villages to hide evidence."

"Forty Level 15s," Victor calculated. "Against our floor traps and a goblin workforce."

"We can hold them," Asterion said. He hefted his massive axe. It was new—steel, purchased with Victor's last investment round. "But not forever."

"We don't need forever," Victor said. "We just need until Sterling realizes how much money he's about to lose."

On the screen, the lead mercenary raised a hand. The group fanned out, approaching the cave mouth.

"They aren't here to arrest us," Victor noted, watching them prime explosive charges. "They're here to liquidate us."

He placed his hand on the Core.

"Nova. Welcome our guests."

The lights in the dungeon flickered from soft blue to combat red.

"Show them," Victor whispered, "why we don't do unpaid overtime."
