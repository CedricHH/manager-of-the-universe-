# Chapter 47: The Revenue Stream

Victor stood before the cave entrance, hands clasped behind his back, analyzing the aesthetic value of a wooden sign.

It was a simple sign, painted by Sniv using a mixture of crushed berries and charcoal. The lettering was crude but legible.

**INSOLVIA HOLDINGS**
*Authorized Entry Point*
*Waiver Required for All Dungeon Activities*

"It lacks... gravitas," Victor murmured.

"It lacks a death threat," Kael critiqued from his leaning spot against a tree. "Most dungeons have skulls on spikes. Or heads on spikes. Or just spikes."

"Spikes imply hostility, Kael. We are projecting *exclusivity*," Victor corrected. He turned to the man sitting at the mahogany desk—which had now been permanently relocated to the left of the cave mouth. "Valerius, how is the wording on the indemnity clause?"

Valerius looked up, ink smudged on his nose. The former Guild Appraiser looked tired, frantic, and oddly alive. He held up a fresh sheet of parchment.

"I think I've found a loophole in the 'High-Risk Recreational Activity' act of 412," Valerius said, tapping the paper with his quill. "If we classify the dungeon crawl as a 'Participatory Archaeological Survey', we aren't liable for dismemberment, death, or psychological trauma. In fact, we can charge them a 'Equipment Disposal Fee' if they die on the premises."

Victor smiled. It was a cold, sharp smile. "Brilliant. And the entry fee?"

"I've termed it a 'Site Preservation Donation'," Valerius said. "Five silver pieces per head. Non-refundable. Tax-deductible if they act as an unregistered charity, which most adventurer parties technically are."

"Five silver," Victor mused. "That's the price of a good meal in the city. Low enough to be negligible for a veteran, high enough to filter out the riff-raff."

"Sniv!" Victor snapped his fingers.

The goblin scuttled out from behind the rock. He was wearing something new. Victor had sacrificed a silk handkerchief, cutting it into a small strip that Sniv now wore around his neck like a primitive tie. It looked ridiculous. It looked professional.

"Boss?" Sniv adjusted his tie with reverence.

"You are the Greeter," Victor said. "Your job is not to bite. Your job is not to stab. Your job is to hand them the clipboard and the quill. If they try to enter without signing, you call Asterion. Do you understand?"

"Sniv understands," the goblin nodded vigorously. "Clip-board. Quill. No stab. Unless no sign?"

"If no sign, Asterion handles the forceful removal. You just smile."

"Sniv practice smile!" The goblin bared his jagged teeth in a terrifying rictus that looked like a piranha trying to be seductive.

"Work on it," Victor advised. "Make it 10% less... predatory."

He checked the sun position. Mid-morning. The prime time for low-level adventurers who liked to sleep in.

"Places everyone," Victor commanded. "Here comes the revenue stream."

**
The "Iron Boots" were exactly the kind of demographic Victor was targeting.

There were four of them. Young, poorly equipped, and radiating the desperate overconfidence of people who thought they were the protagonists of reality. Their leather armor was patched, their swords were second-hand, and their leader—a warrior with a haircut that required too much gel—walked with a swagger that suggested he had killed at least three rats in his basement.

They marched into the clearing, weapons drawn, ready for blood.

They stopped at the desk.

"Halt!" the leader shouted at Valerius. "We are the Iron Boots! We have come to cleanse this foul pit of—"

"Do you have a reservation?" Valerius asked, not looking up from his ledger.

The leader blinked. His sword tip wavered. "A... what?"

"A reservation," Valerius repeated. He adjusted his monocle and looked at the stunned group with the bored disdain of a DMV employee. "This is a controlled access site. Due to high demand, we are operating on a slot system. Do you have a booking reference?"

"We... we're here to slay monsters!" the mage of the group squeaked from the back.

"Yes, yes, the Archaeological Survey," Valerius sighed. He pulled out four sheets of parchment. "Standard Package is five silver per person. Includes entry, one (1) guaranteed combat encounter on Floor 1, and the right to keep 80% of generated loot. The House retains 20% as a processing fee."

The warriors looked at each other. The adrenaline was draining out of them, replaced by the crushing weight of bureaucracy.

"Pay?" the leader sputtered. "To enter a dungeon? That's... that's unheard of!"

Victor stepped out from the shadows. He wore his suit, cleaned and pressed. He looked nothing like a dungeon boss. He looked like the owner.

"It ensures quality," Victor said smoothly. "Think about it. In a free dungeon, you have overcrowding. Kill-stealing. Traps that haven't been reset properly. Here at Insolvia, we curate the experience."

He gestured to the cave mouth.

"Floor 1 has been freshly stocked with goblins. The traps are calibrated for Level 3-5 adventurers. The loot tables have been audited for fairness. You aren't just paying for entry. You're paying for *professionalism*."

The leader looked at the dark cave. Then at his rusty sword. Then at Victor.

"Guaranteed loot?" he asked.

"If you survive the encounter," Victor qualified. "If you don't... well, your next of kin will appreciate the efficiency of our body recovery service. For an extra silver, we offer 'Premium Insurance'."

"We'll take the Standard," the leader grunted. He dug into his pouch and slapped twenty silver pieces onto Valerius's desk.

Valerius swept the coins into a lockbox with a practiced hand. "Sign here. Here. And initial the clause about 'Unforeseen Acid Damage'. Thank you. Sniv, show the gentlemen in."

Sniv stepped forward, wearing his tie and his terrifying smile. He handed each of them a wooden token stamped with a '1'.

"Welcome to Insolvia!" Sniv chirped. "Please keep arms and legs inside the corridor at all times. Have a productive day!"

The Iron Boots walked into the cave, looking less like heroes and more like confused tourists.

As soon as they were out of earshot, Victor exhaled.

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction Complete.
> Revenue: 20 Silver.
> Asset Valuation: +0.01%.
> **Skill UP**: [Market Manipulation] -> Lvl 2.

"It works," Victor whispered. The rush was better than mana. It was the thrill of the deal. "They thanked us. We charged them to come in and try to kill my employees, and they *thanked* us."

"It's the waiver," Valerius said, waving the signed documents. "It makes them feel important. Like they're doing something serious."

"Boss!" Sniv came running back. "They triggered the pit trap! Two fall in! One stick on spike! Very funny!"

"Did they die?"

"No, just leg poke. Cleric healing now."

"Good," Victor nodded. "That's the 'guaranteed combat encounter'. Let them kill a few of the mesmerizing rats, maybe find a rusty dagger or two. Keep them happy. We want repeat business."

**
By noon, three more parties had arrived.

Two paid without question. The third—a group of rangers—tried to sneak in through the ventilation shafts. Asterion caught them, dangled them by their ankles, and Victor offered them a choice: A 50-gold fine for 'Unauthorized Trespassing' or they could buy a 'Season Pass' for 10 gold.

They bought the Season Pass.

Victor sat on a stump, watching the coins pile up in Valerius's box. It wasn't a fortune yet. But it was sustainable. It was a model.

"We need a concession stand," Victor noted. "Healing potions. Bandages. Snacks. If they're waiting in line, we should be monetizing their boredom."

"I can brew weak health potions," Mera offered from where she was cleaning her daggers. "Diluted slime essence and herbs. Taste like gym socks, but they stop bleeding."

"Perfect. Label them 'Insolvia Vitality Draughts'. Charge double the market rate. Convenience fee."

Kael shook his head, looking half-appalled, half-impressed. "You are sucking the soul out of adventuring, Victor."

"I am optimizing it, Kael. In the old world, adventuring was a chaotic mess of blood and luck. Here, it is a transaction. Everyone knows the rules. Everyone gets what they paid for."

"Except the ones who die."

"They paid for the *opportunity*," Victor corrected. "Failure is just negative ROI on their skill investment."

Then, the ground shook.

It wasn't an earthquake. It was the heavy, rhythmic thud of armored horses.

The chatter in the clearing died down. The birds stopped singing.

A party rode into the clearing. They didn't look like the Iron Boots. Their armor was polished steel with gold filigree. Their cloaks were velvet. Their horses were white stallions.

There were six of them. At the front rode a man with a jawline so sharp it could cut glass and a crest on his chest depicting a golden lion eating a sun.

"Nobles," Valerius hissed, shrinking behind his desk. "House Sterling. That's... that's Lord Reginald's colors."

Victor stood up. He smoothed his suit.

The lead rider stopped his horse right in front of the desk. He looked down at Valerius with the sneering contempt that only centuries of inbreeding could produce.

"Peasant," the noble spat. "Move this furniture. My party requires entry."

Valerius trembled. He looked at Victor.

The noble followed his gaze. He looked at Victor—at the strange suit, the calm posture.

"And you," the noble said. "You must be the squatter running this hole. I am Sir Gareth of House Sterling. We are here to claim the Core."

"We are currently at capacity," Victor said calmly. "And the entry fee for a party of your size is... let's see."

He looked at Valerius.

"Valerius, what is the 'Arrogance Surcharge' for Class A Nobles?"

Valerius swallowed. "Uh... fifty percent?"

"Seventy-five," Victor decided. He looked up at the knight. "That will be ten gold pieces. Plus a liability deposit for the horses."

Silence stretched across the clearing. It was thick and heavy.

Sir Gareth laughed. It was a barking, ugly sound.

"Pay?" he sneered. "I am a Sterling. We do not pay scum. We own them."

He drew his sword. It glowed with expensive enchantments.

"Move," Gareth commanded, pointing the blade at Victor's throat. "Or I will burn this booth, gut your goblin, and take your head as a trophy."

Victor didn't blink. He didn't draw a weapon. He didn't cast a spell.

He just looked at the sword. Then at Gareth.

"Sir Gareth," Victor said, his voice dropping to a conversational tone that was somehow louder than a shout. "You are violating the Terms of Service."

He snapped his fingers.

"Asterion. Ticket check."

From the shadows of the cave entrance, a massive hand reached out. It wasn't fast. It was inevitable.

It grabbed the horse's bridle.

Asterion stepped into the sunlight. He was ten feet of muscle, scars, and horns. He wore a custom-made sash that said **SECURITY** across his chest. He held his greataxe in one hand like a toy.

The horse panicked. Gareth fought to control it.

Asterion looked up at the knight. His eyes were flat, bovine, and utterly unimpressed.

"No ticket," Asterion rumbled, his voice like grinding stones. "No entry."

He tightened his grip. The horse was forced to its knees. Gareth tumbled into the dirt with a clang of expensive armor.

Victor walked over to where the noble lay groaning. He leaned down.

"We have a strict dress code," Victor whispered. "And dirt is not in season."

He held out a hand. Not to help Gareth up. But palm up.

" Ten gold," Victor repeated. "Or Asterion processes your refund. And his refund policy involves breaking legs."

Gareth looked up at the minotaur. Then at the goblin sharpening a quill with a manic grin. Then at the man in the suit.

Most of all, he looked at Victor's eyes. And saw zero fear. Zero hesitation. Only calculation.

Gareth reached for his coin purse.
