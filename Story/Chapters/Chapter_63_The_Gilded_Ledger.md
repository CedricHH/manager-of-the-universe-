# Chapter 63: The Gilded Ledger

The Bank of Oakhaven didn't look like a place where money was stored. It looked like a place where money was worshipped.

The Gilded Ledger was a massive structure of white marble and brass, dominating the Merchant Quarter. It had no windows, only a skylight that focused beams of sunlight onto the tellers' cages. The silence inside was heavy, smelling of ink, parchment, and the dry, metallic scent of gold dust.

Valerius adjusted his tie nervously as they walked across the polished floor. His footsteps echoed like gunshots.

"Boss," Valerius whispered. "Be careful. They own the King. They own half the Guild. If we default on a handshake here, they don't send collectors. They send erasure mages."

"Relax, Valerius," Victor said, admiring the ceiling fresco which depicted a golden dragon eating a poor peasant. "We aren't here to beg. We're here to negotiate."

Victor carried a black briefcase. Inside was a single sheet of paper: The ARMI yield projection.

They approached the central desk. An obsidian golem sat behind it.

"Appointment?" the golem rumbled.

"Victor Kaine," Victor said. "For Director Malcom."

The golem didn't check a list. It just nodded. "The Director is expecting you. Penthouse Level."

**The Director's Office**

Director Malcom was a High Elf. This meant he looked roughly thirty years old, but his eyes held the crushing boredom of someone who had watched empires rise and fall and found their fiscal policies lacking.

He sat behind a desk made of Weirwood—priceless, imperishable—and watched Victor enter.

"Mr. Kaine," Malcom said. His voice was smooth, like liquid mercury. "The Dungeon Manager. The man who blackmailed an Inspector and bribed a Prince in the same week. Your credit score is... volatile."

"Volatility creates opportunity," Victor said, taking a seat without being asked. "I assume you received my prospectus."

Malcom tapped a slender finger on a file. "I did. You seek fifty thousand gold pieces. For 'Infrastructure Expansion'."

"Correct. I need to dig deeper. Floors 4 through 6 aren't going to excavate themselves."

"Fifty thousand," Malcom mused. "Doable. The Ledger has liquidity."

He slid a contract across the desk.

"Standard terms. 5% annual interest. And a 30% Equity Stake in Insolvia Holdings."

Victor didn't touch the paper. "Equity?"

"A Board Seat," Malcom clarified. "Veto power over operational changes. Oversight on loot tables. We can't trust a rogue operator with that much capital. We need... assurances."

Victor laughed. It wasn't a nice laugh.

"Director, if you wanted to run a dungeon, you would have bought one. But you didn't. Because you don't know how to monetize slime. You don't know how to negotiate with goblins. You want the profit without the grime."

Malcom’s smile faded slightly. "We want security. 30%. Non-negotiable."

"No," Victor said. "I don't sell pieces of myself. Insolvia remains independent."

"Then there is no loan," Malcom said, reaching for the contract. "And perhaps... perhaps the Ledger decides to finance your competitor. The Adventurer Guild is looking for funding to build a new training facility. One that might render your dungeon obsolete."

It was a naked threat. Civility wrapped around a dagger.

Victor leaned forward. "You fund the Guild, you get a 3% return. Maybe 4% in a good year. It's safe. It's boring. It's... mortal."

Victor opened his briefcase.

"I offer you something better."

He placed the ARMI projection on the desk.

"Don't invest in the company," Victor said. "Invest in the *Yield*."

Malcom looked at the paper. "Explain."

"Loot Futures," Victor said. "I am creating a new financial instrument. You lend me 50,000 gold. In exchange, the Bank receives the rights to 20% of all Rare and Epic loot drops from Floors 4-6 for the next two years."

Malcom paused. His elven eyes narrowed.

"You are securitizing the monsters?"

"I am securitizing the *probability*," Victor corrected. "We know the drop rates. We know the market value of a +1 Fire Sword. You get the upside. If we drop a Legendary Item? You get 20%. If we drop trash? You take the hit. High risk. Infinite reward."

Malcom picked up the paper. He began to calculate. High Elves were faster than computers.

"If your drop rates are accurate," Malcom murmured, "the ROI could exceed 25% annually."

"30%," Victor pushed. "If we hit the motherlode on Floor 6."

"But the risk," Malcom said. "You have a Paladin at your door. Traffic is down."

"Traffic is recovering," Victor countered. "We rebranded the Paladin as a 'Security Feature.' We are attracting a higher class of clientele. Wealthy sinners who want to grind XP under the watchful eye of the Church. The 'Penance Market' is untapped, Director."

Malcom looked at Victor. Really looked at him.

"You are a strange creature, Mr. Kaine. You speak of souls and swords as if they are merely... assets."

"Aren't they?"

Malcom smiled. This time, it was genuine. It was the smile of a predator recognizing another predator.

"Very well. But not fifty thousand. Not yet."

Malcom opened a drawer and pulled out a heavy sack. It clinked with the sound of platinum.

"Ten thousand gold," Malcom said. "A Pilot Tranche. We test your 'Loot Futures' on Floor 4. If the yield meets your projections after thirty days... we unlock the rest."

"Deal," Victor shook the elf's cold hand.

**The Exit**

Valerius held the sack of platinum like it was a baby. "Ten thousand gold, Boss! We're rich! We can build the new trap room! We can give Sniv a raise!"

They walked out into the sunlight. The Paladin, Sir Roland, was still standing there, staring at nothing.

Victor didn't celebrate. He felt a weight on his shoulders that had nothing to do with the money.

"We aren't rich, Valerius," Victor said quietly. "We're leveraged."

"But we got the money!"

"We invited the sharks into the pool," Victor said. "The Bank doesn't just want money. They want data. Malcom will be analyzing every drop, every kill. If we miss our targets... they won't just foreclose. They'll liquidate."

He glanced back at the Gilded Ledger.

In the penthouse window, Director Malcom was watching them.

**The Director's Office - Moments Later**

Malcom watched Victor disappear into the crowd.

He opened a secret compartment in his desk. He pulled out another file. It was stamped with the Sun-Seal of the Church.

**Report: High Priestess Aurelia.**
**Subject: Insolvia Holdings.**
**Verdict: Watch Closely.**

Malcom dipped a quill in ink.

"The Asset has been secured," Malcom wrote. "Financial tethers established. We will know everything he does. If the corruption manifests... we will bankrupt him before you have to burn him."

He sealed the letter.

"Stability," Malcom whispered. "is the only currency that matters."

"Business," Malcom whispered, "is war."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Funds Acquired**: 10,000 GP.
> **Obligation**: Loot Futures (Tier 1).
> **New Threat**: The Gilded Ledger (Surveillance).

**Status**: Funded. But the walls are closing in.

## Author's Note
The financial arc begins. Loot Futures are a real-world concept (securitization) applied to fantasy. This binds Victor's success to RNG, adding a new layer of tension. The reveal that the Bank and Church are colluding raises the stakes—he's being squeezed from both sides.
