# Chapter 29: The Negotiation

The trap corridor was silent.

Silent, until a goblin stepped out of the shadows holding a clipboard.

"Welcome to Insolvia Holdings," Sniv announced, his broken Common somehow sounding almost professional. "Entry fee: 5 GP per person. Please sign waiver before proceeding."

The Iron Wolves froze.

Gareth's hand went to his sword. Mira's staff crackled with pre-charged energy. Bron raised his shield. Tessa, the young rogue, simply stared.

"What the—" Gareth started.

"Is that goblin offering us *paperwork*?" Mira interrupted, genuine confusion breaking through her professional composure.

Sniv held up the clipboard patiently. "All visitors must register. Company policy. Liability reasons."

"This wasn't how dungeons worked. Dungeons didn't have *customer service representatives*.

"I've cleared twelve dungeons in the last year," Gareth snarled, his eyes darting to the shadows where Sniv had appeared. "Not once did I have to pay for the privilege of killing a few green-skins. Usually, it's the other way around—I kill the boss and take *his* gold."

"Old model," Sniv replied, tapping the clipboard with a claw. "Inefficient. High casualty rates for both sides. Insolvia Holdings is pivoting to a service-based economy. You pay for the experience. We provide the infrastructure."

Mira leaned in, pushing Gareth's sword arm down slightly. She was looking at the waiver. "Gareth, look at the clauses. Sections 4.2 through 4.8. They’ve actually codified the loot rights. Usually, if we find a unique item in a Guild-registered dungeon, the Guild claims a first-right-of-refusal. This contract states that once the entry fee is paid, the 'Visitor' retains one hundred percent ownership of all non-structural assets acquired."

"Non-structural?" Gareth asked.

"Means you can't take the walls," Sniv clarified. "Or the Core. Everything else is fair game."

"And the 'Liability Waiver'?" Tessa asked, her voice small. "Does it mean they won't kill us?"

"It means that in the event of unforeseen mortality, the 'Host Entity'—that's us—is not legally responsible for the loss of potential future earnings," Sniv recited. It was clear he’d spent hours memorizing the script Victor had written for him. "However, as per the premium guarantee, we will facilitate the return of your remains to the surface for a nominal shipping fee."

"They're treating our deaths like a line item," Mira whispered, a strange mixture of horror and fascination on her face. "Gareth, this isn't a dungeon. It's an office building with monsters."

Victor's voice echoed through the corridor, amplified by the Core's newly activated speaker system.

"Adventurers. I'm offering you a deal."

Four heads turned, searching for the source. They wouldn't find him—he was monitoring from the Core Chamber, watching through crystalline sensors.

"Pay the entry fee. Navigate the dungeon. Keep one hundred percent of any loot you acquire. No Guild cut. No registration fees. No questions asked."

Mira's eyes narrowed. "Who are you?"

"The Manager."

"Dungeons don't have managers."

"This one does." Victor let that sink in. "Twenty gold pieces total. Four adventurers, five gold each. In exchange, you get three floors of curated challenges, optional premium encounters, and a loot room stocked with items actually worth carrying home."

Gareth snorted. "We don't negotiate with monsters."

"Then leave." Victor's voice was cold. "The exit is behind you. No one is forcing you to stay."

Silence.

Mira stepped forward. "What's the catch?"

"No catch. I profit from your survival, not your death. Dead adventurers are liability. Living customers are revenue." Victor paused. "Also, if you die, your next of kin receives a fifty gold refund. Death insurance, included with premium package."

"This is insane," Gareth muttered.

"This is *business*," Victor corrected. "Your choice. Pay and play, or leave and tell your Guild that a dungeon offered you better terms than they do."

The party huddled. Whispered arguments.

Gareth wanted to fight. Mira wanted information. Bron shrugged—he followed orders either way. Tessa, surprisingly, spoke up: "I vote we pay. This is... interesting."

Three to one. The gold changed hands.

"Welcome to Insolvia Holdings," Victor said. "Enjoy your visit. Sniv will guide you to the first challenge zone."

*The investigation took three weeks.*

*Victor used every contact he still had. Called in favors from people who owed him. Hired a forensic accountant under a false name. Cross-referenced shipping manifests with supplier contracts, supplier contracts with board meeting minutes, board meeting minutes with his own efficiency protocols.*

*The evidence multiplied.*

*The board had known. Every single one of them. They'd signed off on the supplier selection. They'd approved the shipping routes. They'd read the reports that flagged "sourcing concerns" and buried them under layers of corporate double-speak.*

*And Victor?*

*Victor had made it worse.*

*His efficiency protocols hadn't just maintained the existing system—they'd accelerated it. His pressure for better margins had pushed suppliers to cut corners. His spreadsheets had increased demand for materials that came from mines where children died in darkness.*

*He'd never asked where the numbers came from.*

*That was the crime. Not active evil. Passive blindness. The calculation that ran perfectly because no one inputted the human cost.*

*In the weeks that followed, Victor had become a ghost in his own city. He took long walks through the Chicago Loop, watching the thousands of professionals in their tailored suits, their briefcases clutched like shields. He saw himself in every one of them—the focus on the next target, the obsession with the quarterly report, the absolute certainty that they were the protagonists of their own stories.*

*He’d tried to confront Arthur, his mentor. He’d waited outside the private club, his breath misting in the winter air.*

*"You knew, Arthur," he’d said when the older man emerged, smelling of expensive tobacco and cedarwood.*

*Arthur hadn't even looked at him. "Everyone knows, Victor. That’s how the world works. We build the high ground so we don't have to see the valley. Don't be a child."*

*That was the final blow. It wasn't that they were hiding the truth; it was that the truth was considered a childish distraction. Efficiency was the only adult virtue.*

*When the "legal patch" finally arrived—in the form of a non-disclosure agreement with a seven-figure payout and a permanent ban from the industry—Victor hadn't even read the terms. He’d just signed. He wanted to be done with a world that was so beautifully polished and so foundationally rotten.*

*But the Consortium... they didn't offer a payout. They offered a reset. They offered him a place where he could build a system from the ground up. A place where he could finally, for the first time in his life, be the one who decided where the numbers came from.*

Floor 2: The Fungal Gardens.

Sniv led the Iron Wolves through bioluminescent mushroom forests, pointing out "optional challenge areas" with extra loot for extra risk. The party was adjusting—slowly—to the dungeon's unconventional approach.

"This is... actually well-designed," Mira admitted, examining a cluster of glowing fungi. "Resource distribution is logical. Threat escalation is appropriate for party level."

"It's a trap," Gareth insisted.

Victor's voice crackled from a hidden speaker. "Of course it's a trap. All dungeons are traps. The question is: whose trap benefits you more? Mine, with transparent terms and guaranteed loot quality? Or the Guild's twenty percent cut on every transaction, with no quality control whatsoever?"

Mira turned toward the speaker—or where she thought it was. "What's your angle, Manager? Why change how dungeons work?"

"Because the traditional model is inefficient. Kill adventurers, take their stuff, wait for more. No repeat customers. No brand loyalty. No market expansion." Victor paused. "I prefer sustainable revenue streams."

"You talk like a merchant who swallowed a textbook," Mira called out, her voice echoing in the bioluminescent chamber. "And yet, the magic I'm sensing... it's not merchant-gold. It's Dungeon-Source. You're bonded to the Core."

"I am the Core's administrator," Victor replied. "And its partner."

"Partner?" Mira stopped, gesturing for the party to wait. She looked up at the ceiling, trying to trace the mana pulse. "Cores don't have partners. They have tools. They have servants. They don't... they don't share equity."

"They do when the alternative is insolvency," Victor said. "Ask yourself, Mira. Why are you here? Because the Guild sent you on a 'Rank-B scouting mission.' They're paying you a flat fee, keeping the majority of the risk profile on your shoulders, and providing zero insurance. If you die here, they'll replace the Iron Wolves with another party by Tuesday. To them, you're a spawn. To me? You're a high-value client."

Gareth spat on the floor. "I don't care about your speeches. I want to see this 'Epic' reward you promised."

"Patience, Gareth," Victor’s voice smoothed. "A well-designed customer journey requires proper pacing. Enjoy the Fungal Gardens. Observe the trap mechanics. They are quite innovative. Zip, our CTO, worked very hard on them."

Mira looked at the cluster of mushrooms they’d just bypassed. "Innovated... how?"

"Check your boots," Victor suggested.

Mira sighed, looking down. A fine, glowing dust was clinging to the leather of her party's footwear. "Spores? Contact poison?"

"No. Tracking-tags," Victor said, and the party could almost hear him smiling. "We’re collecting data on your movement patterns to optimize future layout iterations. Don’t worry, it’s all covered in the privacy policy on page 4."

Gareth laughed harshly. "You're trying to turn murder into a subscription service."

"I'm trying to turn a dying dungeon into a viable enterprise. Your survival is incidental but beneficial." Victor let that settle. "Now. You've paid for three floors. Would you like to discuss the optional premium encounter on Floor 4?"

Mira's interest sharpened. "What's the premium encounter?"

"Boss-class opponent. Recommended for parties above Level 15. Additional fee: ten gold. Reward tier: Epic."

The party exchanged glances.

"And if we lose?" Tessa asked.

"Five gold insurance covers non-lethal defeat. You wake up at the entrance, keep all items acquired before the boss, receive a participation certificate, and can try again next week at a discounted rate."

Silence.

Then Bron—who had said almost nothing the entire run—spoke: "Fair."

Three words in two hours. Highest endorsement possible from a professional tank.

Mira nodded. "We'll take the premium package."

Fifteen more gold changed hands.

> **[ARMI - REVENUE TRACKING]**
> Current Total: 35 GP
> Previous Average: 15 GP
> Target (50% increase): 22.5 GP
> Status: TARGET EXCEEDED (133% of baseline)

Victor allowed himself a small smile.

The proof was accumulating. And the party hadn't even reached the boss room yet.
