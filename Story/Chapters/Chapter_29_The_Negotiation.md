# Chapter 29: The Negotiation

The trap corridor was silent.

Silent, until a goblin stepped out of the shadows holding a clipboard.

"Welcome to Insolvia Holdings," Sniv announced, his broken Common somehow sounding almost professional. "Entry fee: 5 GP per person. Please sign waiver before proceeding."

The Iron Wolves froze.

Gareth's hand went to his sword. Mira's staff crackled with pre-charged energy. Bron raised his shield. Tessa, the young rogue, simply stared.

"What the—" Gareth started.

"Is that goblin offering us *paperwork*?" Mira interrupted, genuine confusion breaking through her professional composure.

Sniv held up the clipboard patiently. "All visitors must register. Company policy. Liability reasons."

"Kill it," Gareth ordered.

Bron took a step forward. Tessa didn't move.

"Killing staff voids liability waiver," Sniv continued, unfazed. "All loot rights forfeited. Management reserves right to deploy lethal force in response. Please reconsider."

The party hesitated. This wasn't how dungeons worked. Dungeons didn't have *customer service representatives*.

Victor's voice echoed through the corridor, amplified by the Core's newly activated speaker system.

"Adventurers. I'm offering you a deal."

Four heads turned, searching for the source. They wouldn't find him—he was monitoring from the Core Chamber, watching through crystalline sensors.

"Pay the entry fee. Navigate the dungeon. Keep one hundred percent of any loot you acquire. No Guild cut. No registration fees. No questions asked."

Mira's eyes narrowed. "Who are you?"

"The Manager."

"Dungeons don't have managers."

"This one does." Victor let that sink in. "Twenty gold pieces total. Four adventurers, five gold each. In exchange, you get three floors of curated challenges, optional premium encounters, and a loot room stocked with items actually worth carrying home."

Gareth snorted. "We don't negotiate with monsters."

"Then leave." Victor's voice was cold. "The exit is behind you. No one is forcing you to stay."

Silence.

Mira stepped forward. "What's the catch?"

"No catch. I profit from your survival, not your death. Dead adventurers are liability. Living customers are revenue." Victor paused. "Also, if you die, your next of kin receives a fifty gold refund. Death insurance, included with premium package."

"This is insane," Gareth muttered.

"This is *business*," Victor corrected. "Your choice. Pay and play, or leave and tell your Guild that a dungeon offered you better terms than they do."

The party huddled. Whispered arguments.

Gareth wanted to fight. Mira wanted information. Bron shrugged—he followed orders either way. Tessa, surprisingly, spoke up: "I vote we pay. This is... interesting."

Three to one. The gold changed hands.

"Welcome to Insolvia Holdings," Victor said. "Enjoy your visit. Sniv will guide you to the first challenge zone."

*The investigation took three weeks.*

*Victor used every contact he still had. Called in favors from people who owed him. Hired a forensic accountant under a false name. Cross-referenced shipping manifests with supplier contracts, supplier contracts with board meeting minutes, board meeting minutes with his own efficiency protocols.*

*The evidence multiplied.*

*The board had known. Every single one of them. They'd signed off on the supplier selection. They'd approved the shipping routes. They'd read the reports that flagged "sourcing concerns" and buried them under layers of corporate double-speak.*

*And Victor?*

*Victor had made it worse.*

*His efficiency protocols hadn't just maintained the existing system—they'd accelerated it. His pressure for better margins had pushed suppliers to cut corners. His spreadsheets had increased demand for materials that came from mines where children died in darkness.*

*He'd never asked where the numbers came from.*

*That was the crime. Not active evil. Passive blindness. The calculation that ran perfectly because no one inputted the human cost.*

Floor 2: The Fungal Gardens.

Sniv led the Iron Wolves through bioluminescent mushroom forests, pointing out "optional challenge areas" with extra loot for extra risk. The party was adjusting—slowly—to the dungeon's unconventional approach.

"This is... actually well-designed," Mira admitted, examining a cluster of glowing fungi. "Resource distribution is logical. Threat escalation is appropriate for party level."

"It's a trap," Gareth insisted.

Victor's voice crackled from a hidden speaker. "Of course it's a trap. All dungeons are traps. The question is: whose trap benefits you more? Mine, with transparent terms and guaranteed loot quality? Or the Guild's twenty percent cut on every transaction, with no quality control whatsoever?"

Mira turned toward the speaker—or where she thought it was. "What's your angle, Manager? Why change how dungeons work?"

"Because the traditional model is inefficient. Kill adventurers, take their stuff, wait for more. No repeat customers. No brand loyalty. No market expansion." Victor paused. "I prefer sustainable revenue streams."

Gareth laughed harshly. "You're trying to turn murder into a subscription service."

"I'm trying to turn a dying dungeon into a viable enterprise. Your survival is incidental but beneficial." Victor let that settle. "Now. You've paid for three floors. Would you like to discuss the optional premium encounter on Floor 4?"

Mira's interest sharpened. "What's the premium encounter?"

"Boss-class opponent. Recommended for parties above Level 15. Additional fee: ten gold. Reward tier: Epic."

The party exchanged glances.

"And if we lose?" Tessa asked.

"Five gold insurance covers non-lethal defeat. You wake up at the entrance, keep all items acquired before the boss, receive a participation certificate, and can try again next week at a discounted rate."

Silence.

Then Bron—who had said almost nothing the entire run—spoke: "Fair."

Three words in two hours. Highest endorsement possible from a professional tank.

Mira nodded. "We'll take the premium package."

Fifteen more gold changed hands.

> **[ARMI - REVENUE TRACKING]**
> Current Total: 35 GP
> Previous Average: 15 GP
> Target (50% increase): 22.5 GP
> Status: TARGET EXCEEDED (133% of baseline)

Victor allowed himself a small smile.

The proof was accumulating. And the party hadn't even reached the boss room yet.
