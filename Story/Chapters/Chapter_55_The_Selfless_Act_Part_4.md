# Chapter 55: The Selfless Act (Part 4)

**EARTH. THREE DAYS LATER.**

The ice in Victor's glass had melted.

He sat in the living room of his penthouse apartment, the lights dimmed, the city skyline spread out below him like a circuit board of diamonds and darkness. The television was muted, but the chyron on the news channel was screaming in bright red block letters:

**BREAKING: PROJECT COBALT EXPOSED. BOARD UNDER INVESTIGATION. STOCK PLUNGES 14%.**

It had begun.

Six hours ago, the first leak had hit the wire services. Four hours ago, the Justice Department had announced a preliminary inquiry. Two hours ago, the board had issued a statement denying "all allegations of impropriety" while simultaneously announcing the formation of an "independent ethics committee."

Victor knew what that meant. It meant they were panicking. It meant the evidence was irrefutable. It meant they were burning documents, shredding hard drives, and making frantic phone calls to people who specialized in damage control.

And damage liquidation.

Victor swirled the watered-down scotch. He didn't like scotch — it was inefficient, a purely sensory indulgence that dulled cognitive function — but tonight, it felt appropriate. A prop for the final scene.

He checked his watch. 11:42 PM.

He'd calculated seventy-two hours. It had been seventy-one. They were ahead of schedule.

The sound came from the front door. Not a knock. Not a kick. Just the soft, mechanical *click* of the electronic lock disengaging. A bypass tool. High-end. Government issue, or private contractor equivalent.

Victor didn't stand up. He didn't run to the bedroom where a normal man might keep a gun. He didn't reach for the phone.

He took a sip of the scotch.

The door opened.

---

The man who entered was dressed in building maintenance coveralls. Gray. Generic. The kind of outfit that rendered a person invisible in any corporate environment. He wore gloves. No mask.

That was the detail that confirmed the calculation. You only wore a mask if you intended to leave a witness behind.

The man stepped into the living room, closing the door softly behind him. He saw Victor sitting in the armchair. He didn't startle. He didn't pause. He moved with the fluid economy of a professional who had done this a hundred times before.

"Mr. Kaine," the man said. It wasn't a question.

"You made good time," Victor replied. "Traffic is usually terrible on the bridge this time of night."

The professional didn't smile. He reached into the deep pocket of his coveralls and produced a pistol. Matte black. Suppressor attached. Another tool. Just like the lockpick. Just like the coveralls.

"Stand up, please."

Victor noted the politeness. A nice touch. Even terminations had a protocol.

He stood. He set the glass down on the side table. He straightened his jacket, smoothing the lapels.

"Is there a script?" Victor asked. "Do you ask me why I did it? Do I beg for my life? Or do we skip straight to the transaction?"

"Turning around would be easier," the man said. "For both of us."

"I prefer to see the data."

The man nodded once. He raised the weapon.

Victor looked at the black circle of the barrel. He thought it would look bigger. In movies, it always looked like a cannon. In reality, it was just a small, mechanical aperture. A delivery system for kinetic energy.

He thought about the folder. The thumb drive. The forty-seven faces he had memorized. The two hundred futures he had purchased with this moment.

*ROI calculation complete.*
*Cost: One unit (depreciating).*
*Benefit: Two hundred units (projected).*
*Net Value: Positive.*

Victor Kaine closed his eyes.

"Proceed."

The sound was smaller than he expected. A sharp cough. A sudden pressure in his chest.

Then darkness.

---

**THE VOID.**

There was no light. There was no sound. There was no time.

Victor existed. That was the extent of his reality. He was a consciousness suspended in a vacuum, stripped of sensory input, stripped of context, stripped of the biological machinery that processed fear or pain or regret.

He waited.

He assumed this was death. The null state. The final zero in the equation.

But then, there was... observation.

Not eyes. Not a gaze. A *review*.

Something vast and cold and infinitely bureaucratic turned its attention toward him. It felt like being audited by a hurricane. It felt like having his soul stripped down to its metadata and run through a heuristic filter.

Words — or the concept of words — projected directly into his awareness.

The void collapsed.

**TERRA-INSOLVIA. THE DUNGEON.**

Pain.

Sharp. Cold. Physical.

Victor gasped, his lungs filling with air that smelled of damp earth and decay. He coughed, his body convulsing, his hands scrabbling against rough stone.

He opened his eyes.

Dim light. The ceiling was rock, uneven and dripping with moisture. Shadows danced in the corners, thrown by a pulsing, erratic light source in the center of the room — a large, cracked crystal that hummed with a sickly rhythm.

Victor lay on the floor. He was wearing his suit. It was ruined — torn, dusty, stained with... something dark.

He sat up. His chest ached, a phantom pressure where the bullet had struck. He reached up, his fingers probing the fabric of his shirt. No hole. No blood. Just a scar on the skin beneath, round and puckered.

"Alive," he whispered. The word scraped his throat. "How?"

A skittering sound from the shadows.

Victor turned. His predator instincts, honed in boardrooms and hostile takeovers, flared to life.

A creature emerged from the darkness. Small. Green. Wretched. It had oversized ears and eyes that darted nervously around the room. It wore a loincloth that was little more than a rag. In its hand, it clutched a rusty, jagged piece of metal.

A goblin.

The creature hissed, stepping closer. Its intent was clear. It saw a weakened prey. A meal. Or perhaps just something to rob.

"Give," the goblin rasped, pointing the metal shank. "Shiny. Give."

Victor looked at the creature. He looked at the rusty weapon. He looked at the cracked crystal pulsing in the center of the room.

He stood up. He was dizzy, weak, disoriented. But he was Victor Kaine.

He smoothed his torn jacket. He adjusted his tie, though it hung loosely around his neck. He stood to his full height and looked down at the goblin with the same cold, analytical gaze he had used to dismantle CEOs and intimidate union leaders.

"You have poor posture," Victor said. "And your weapon is tetanus waiting to happen."

The goblin blinked. It lowered the shank, confused. "What?"

"I am not a victim," Victor said. "I am a restructuring opportunity."

He took a step forward. The goblin took a step back.

"What is your name?"

"Sniv," the creature squeaked.

"Sniv." Victor nodded. "Congratulations, Sniv. You are my first employee. Put down the metal shard. We have work to do."

---

**PRESENT DAY.**

"BOSS!"

The scream ripped through reality.

Victor staggered, his hands slamming onto the stone table of the War Room. The map of Eastmarch scattered. Ink pots overturned.

"Boss! Breathe! Boss forget to breathe!"

Sniv was there, clutching his arm, eyes wide with panic. Asterion had stepped forward, his massive hand hovering protectively. Zip was chattering in high-pitched distress.

Victor gasped, sucking in air.

The War Room was bright. Nova's light was strong, steady, healthy — nothing like the sickly pulse of that first day. The walls were reinforced. The floor was paved. His suit was immaculate.

The memory settled. Like a heavy stone sinking into a deep lake, it found its place at the bottom of his mind.

He remembered the gun. He remembered the void. He remembered the interview.

He hadn't been saved. He hadn't been given a second chance out of charity or karma or divine benevolence.

He had been *recruited*.

The Galactic Audit Consortium hadn't looked at his sacrifice and seen a hero. They had looked at his math and seen a manager.

"I'm fine," Victor said. His voice was steady. Stronger than it had been a moment ago. "I'm fine."

He straightened up. He looked at his hands. No tremors. No doubt.

The last piece of the puzzle had clicked into place. He understood now. He understood *exactly* what he was.

> Status: 100%.  
> Trauma: Processed.  
> Psychological Efficiency: +15%.

> **Current Objective**: Pass the second.

"ROYAL ENTOURAGE DETECTED," Nova's voice boomed, resonant and clear. "CROWN PRINCE ALDRIC'S VANGUARD. ESTIMATED ARRIVAL: FOUR HOURS."

Victor looked at the projection on the wall. The approaching blips. The royal banner. The challenge.

He looked at Sniv. The wretched creature from the memory was gone, replaced by a loyal, terrified, competent Head of HR.

"Sniv," Victor said.

"Yes, Boss?"

"Get the welcome committee ready. Polish the floors. Prepare the presentation."

Victor smiled. It was the sharpest, coldest, most dangerous smile he had worn since arriving in this world.

"Let them come. I passed the Consortium's interview. Let's see if the Prince can pass his performance review."
