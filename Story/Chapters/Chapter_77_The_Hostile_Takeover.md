# Chapter 77: The Hostile Takeover

The dashboard in Victor’s administrative office hummed with the soft, blue glow of a hundred data points. Across the primary projection, the Rivercrest pilot site was a flurry of activity—most of it unauthorized.

"Status report, ARMI," Victor said, his voice flat, devoid of the panic that usually accompanied a siege. He leaned back in his leather chair, a cup of lukewarm kaff in one hand.

> **[ARMI]**
> Status: REGULATORY BREACH DETECTED | Transaction: [Risk Audit]
> Threat Level: TIER 3 (COALITION ASSEMBLED)
> Current Loss Projection: 154 GP/min | Liability Shift: 12%

"Only twelve percent?" Victor frowned, tapping his fingers against the armrest. "We need to get those numbers up. Elara, do you copy?"

He tapped a secondary icon on the desk. A small window flickered to life, showing Lady Elara Ravenshield. She was standing before the heavy, half-finished stone gates of the Rivercrest franchise. She looked regal even in her scratched plate armor, her hand resting on the hilt of a sword she no longer had the divine right to wield.

Opposite her, a man in robes of white and gold—Arbitrator Valen—adjusted his spectacles, flanked by a dozen heavily armed mercenaries.

"Victor," Elara’s voice came through the link, tight with controlled fury. "They’re citing the Public Heroics Act. They claim this facility is an unregulated hazard to the kingdom’s spiritual and physical safety."

"Standard hostile takeover rhetoric," Victor noted. "How’s the Arbitrator holding up?"

"He’s trembling," Elara replied, glancing at Valen. "But Groll is behind him. The Guildmaster isn't here for a debate. He brought the demolition crews."

Victor zoomed in on the figure standing amidst the mercenary ranks. Guildmaster Groll of the Alchemist’s Guild looked less like a scholar and more like a scavenger who had stumbled into a fortune. He was holding a glass vial filled with a pulsing, violet liquid—liquid fire, refined specifically for stone structures.

"Victor Kaine!" Valen’s voice echoed through the external speakers at the site. "By the authority of the High Priestess and the Unified Guild Coalition, this site is hereby seized for public audit. Lower your defenses and vacate the premises, or we will authorize a forced entry."

Victor smiled. It wasn't a pleasant expression. It was the smile of a man who had seen this exact scenario play out in at least three different boardrooms, usually involving private security and a very expensive severance package.

"Valen," Victor's voice boomed from the hidden microphones embedded in the gatehouse. "You’re citing the Act of 842. Unfortunately, my legal team—specifically the Merchant Guild’s compliance department—reminds me that the Royal Proclamations of Chapter 75 granted this site 'Experimental Enterprise' status. You have no jurisdiction here."

The Arbitrator hesitated, looking back at Groll. 

"The Law is whatever the Church says it is!" Groll roared, stepping forward. He didn't care about experimental status. He cared about the fact that Victor’s cheap slime-base potions were going to bankrupt his monopoly in six months. "This isn't a business, it's a plague! Tear it down!"

A mercenary captain—a man named Kael with a hammer the size of a goblin’s torso—stepped forward. With a grunt of effort, he swung at the gate.

*CLANG.*

The sound echoed through the valley. The stone didn't break. A shimmering layer of magical reinforcement—a byproduct of Victor’s new [Resource Reallocation] skill—absorbed the impact.

> **[ARMI]**
> Event: UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY | Status: CLAIM FILED
> Damage Incurred: 2,400 GP | Category: RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT
> Note: Structural integrity compromised; liability shift active.

"Perfect," Victor whispered. "Asterion, how are we looking?"

From the shadows of the unlit corridor behind Elara, a massive silhouette shifted. Asterion, the Minotaur Manager, stepped into the light. He wasn't wearing his usual administrative robe; he was clad in heavy, black iron, the symbol of the Ember Trials etched into his chest plate.

"First wave is committed, Master," Asterion rumbled. His voice was like grinding stones. "The Gold-ranks are eager. They think they’re sacking an empty building."

"Let them believe it for another three minutes," Victor commanded. "Elara, move to Safety Protocol B. Get the employees—the *voluntary* ones—into the shelters. Make sure they’re seen leaving by the Church observers. I want the 'Imminent Danger to Workforce' tags for the liability report."

"I hate how you think, Victor," Elara said, but she was already signaling the workers.

"You like the ethical clauses in your contract, Elara," Victor countered. "This is how we pay for them."

At the gate, the scene descended into chaos. Groll threw the first vial of violet fire. The explosion scorched the masonry, turning the beautiful, white marble Victor had imported from the Southern Quarries into blackened, jagged soot.

Victor’s nose wrinkled as the sharp smell of burnt calcium and expensive stone reached him through the ventilation. He hadn’t just lost a wall; he had lost a Grade-A asset he’d spent three weeks negotiating for. Even as the loss counter ticked upward, he found himself calculating the exact logistics of the replacement shipment.

Victor watched the "Loss Meter" on his screen. Every explosion was a payout. Every broken window was a credit to his account. 

"Groll is using Tier 4 alchemical agents," Victor noted, his eyes narrowing. "That’s a violation of the International Trade Agreement on Siege Weaponry. ARMI, record the residue signatures. We’ll sue for the difference later."

Kael’s mercenaries were now swarming the walls. They were professionals, moving with surgical precision. They expected traps—poison needles, pit falls, monsters. 

They found none of those. Instead, they found a maze of sliding glass partitions and confusing corridors designed for maximum acoustic resonance.

"Trigger Phase 2," Victor ordered.

Asterion stepped forward. He didn't charge. He simply stood at the end of the main hallway, his great-axe resting on his shoulder.

"In the name of Management," Asterion boomed, "this floor is closed for unauthorized auditing."

The mercenaries laughed. A Gold-rank warrior with a glowing longsword lunged forward. "Move aside, beast! This dungeon is being liquidated!"

Asterion’s response was a blur of black iron. He didn't use the edge of his axe; he used the flat of it. The warrior was launched backward, crashing through three sets of expensive glass partitions.

> **[ARMI]**
> Balance: +12,800 GP (Projected) | Status: AGGRESSOR CONFIRMED
> Property Damage: 12,800 GP | Liability Scale: 42%
> Worker Stress Rating: NOMINAL

"Victor," Elara's voice returned, now coming from inside the gatehouse. "The Arbitrator is fleeing, but Groll is bringing up the heavy hitters. He has three Alchemical Golems in the rear. If they hit the core room of this site, the insurance won't cover the loss of the pilot data."

"They won't get that far," Victor said. He stood up, walking over to the main projection. He placed his hand on the glass. "[Efficiency Optimization]... Level 2. Reallocate density from the non-essential outer walls to the primary storage vault. Now."

The site groaned. The very stones of the Rivercrest franchise seemed to flow, thinning the exterior decorative pillars to thicken the walls around the sensitive research equipment. 

To the attackers, it looked like the building was collapsing. To Victor, it was a data migration.

"Asterion, shift to Force Multiplier mode," Victor commanded. "We’ve got the documentation we need. Now, I want them tired. I want them frustrated. And I want them to think they’re winning right up until the point they realize they’ve spent fifty thousand gold pieces of equipment to break into a glorified storage unit."

Guildmaster Groll, watching from the outside, was screaming orders. The smell of smoke and ozone filled the air. He thought he was winning. He thought he was destroying Victor Kaine’s future.

He didn't realize he was currently funding it.

"Sir," Sniv’s voice chirped from the door. The goblin was carrying a stack of revised contracts and a ledger. "The Merchant Guild representative is on the line. He’s... he’s crying, sir. He says the payouts are too high."

"Tell him to check his Reinsurance Clause," Victor said without looking back. "The Church has deep pockets. They’ll be the ones footing the final bill in the Arbitration courts."

Suddenly, the ground shook. A massive explosion, larger than any previous one, rocked the Rivercrest site. A pillar of white fire erupted from the center of the construction.

"Status!" Victor shouted.

> **[ARMI]**
> Event: CORE BREACH (SIMULATED) | Status: SUCCESSFUL DECEPTION
> Result: ASSETS SECURED | Data Migration: 100% COMPLETE
> Warning: Aggressors believe facility is neutralized.

Victor let out a long breath. He sat back down. Through the smoke, he saw Groll cheering, his mercenaries planting the Coalition flag atop the ruins of the main hall.

"They did it," the Arbitrator said, his voice trembling as he returned. "The hazard is neutralized."

"Excellent," Victor whispered to the empty room. He opened a new communication channel—not to the site, but to a very specific office in Oakhaven.

"Voros? It’s Kaine. I’d like to file a claim for the total loss of the Rivercrest Pilot Facility. Yes, the entire thing. The documentation is already in your inbox. I believe the settlement figure is... eighty-five thousand gold pieces?"

He listened for a moment. He could practically hear the Merchant’s Guild representative choking on his tongue.

"No, I don’t want to rebuild yet," Victor said, his eyes on the screen as Groll began his celebratory speech to the adventurers. "I want to take the capital. I want to expand into the Northern Territories. After all... it looks like the Adventurer’s Guild has left their hometowns very poorly defended while they were busy ‘liquidation’ my business."

He looked at the projected map of the region. The Rivercrest site was a blackened ruin, but the red icons representing the Guild's presence elsewhere were blinking. Unguarded. Exposed.

"ARMI," Victor said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Initiate the Hostile Acquisition Protocol. If they want to play at warfare, we’ll play at economics."

The cliffhanger hung in the air: the destruction of Victor’s franchise was not a defeat. It was a massive, insurance-funded capital injection for a much larger war.

"Asterion, Elara... regroup," Victor commanded. "Phase One of the Dungeon War is complete. We just got paid to lose. Now, let’s show them what a real takeover looks like."

> **[ARMI]**
> Balance: 85,000 GP (Projected) | Status: LIQUIDATION COMPLETE
> Strategic Advantage: TOTAL | Next Target: Guild Treasury

Victor Kaine closed the dashboard. The room went dark, leaving only the faint, ominous glow of the gold counter in the corner of the screen.

It was already ticking upward.
