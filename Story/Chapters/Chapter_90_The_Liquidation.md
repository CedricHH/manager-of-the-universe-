# Chapter 90: The Liquidation

The crossbow bolt was aimed at Barnaby's chest, but Victor was analyzing the bandit leader's boots.

Blackwood leather. Oil-treated. The kind issued to Imperial scouts three campaigns ago.

"You're ex-military," Victor said. Not a question.

The leader—missing an ear, missing teeth, but *not* missing tactical awareness—kept his smile fixed. "Retired, you might say."

"Dishonorably discharged," Victor corrected. "Eighty-seven percent probability. You kept the boots. Sentimental value, or you couldn't afford new ones?"

The smile cracked slightly.

Victor's eyes flicked past the twelve visible bandits to the treeline. Twenty. Thirty. Maybe more.

Professional spacing. Crossfire angles. Escape routes covered.

"This isn't a toll," Victor said quietly. "This is a contract."

He activated `[Performance Review]`.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Target:** Kade the Earless
> **Class:** Sellsword (Level 14)
> **Employer:** [CONTRACT BOUND - ENCRYPTED]
> **Mission Parameters:** CAPTURE ALIVE. Bounty: 25,000 GP.
> **Contract Type:** Magically Binding (Suicide Clause Active)

Victor's internal ledger updated.

They weren't here to rob him. They were here to *deliver* him.

"Seventy-eight percent probability you were hired by someone who knows I'm worth more alive than dead," Victor said, lowering his hands slowly. "Twenty-two percent you're just very stupid. Which is it?"

Kade's crossbow didn't waver, but his eyes narrowed. "Confident words for a man surrounded."

"You're not *surrounding* me," Victor replied. "You're *appraising* me. There's a difference. Who hired you?"

"Confidential." Kade gestured to his men. Two stepped forward with rope. "Business is business."

"Then let's talk business."

Victor didn't move. Didn't flinch. He just stood there, hands visible, ledger open in his mind.

"You have forty-two men," Victor continued. "Average level twelve, based on equipment quality. If we fight, you'll win. Eventually. But I'll take ten of you with me—maybe fifteen if Barnaby panics and starts throwing alchemical vials from the wagon."

Barnaby, pale-faced on the driver's bench, squeaked: "I have vials?!"

"You do now," Victor lied smoothly. "Labeled 'In Case of Ambush.' Explosive."

Kade's men shifted nervously.

Victor pressed the advantage. "So: Option A. You fight. You lose forty to sixty percent of your force. Funeral costs, medical debts, reduced operational capacity. You collect your twenty-five thousand gold bounty. Minus expenses. Net profit: maybe twelve thousand. Split forty-two ways."

He paused.

"Option B. I hire you instead. Thirty thousand gold. Right now. No deaths. No expenses."

Kade barked a laugh. "You expect me to believe a merchant has thirty thousand just lying around?"

Victor turned. Walked calmly back to the Gilded Caravan. Opened the rear vault door.

The interior glittered.

Gold coins. Stacked in neat rows. Sixty thousand GP worth, meticulously organized by denomination.

The bandits stared.

Victor gestured at the vault like a salesman presenting inventory. "I'm not a merchant. I'm a liquidation specialist. This is petty cash."

Kade's crossbow lowered. Just a fraction.

"You're serious."

"I'm *always* serious when it comes to payroll efficiency," Victor said. "You're wasting resources on a contract with terrible terms. I'm offering you a counter-proposal."

"I can't just break a contract." Kade tapped his chest. A faint green glow pulsed beneath his shirt—a binding sigil. "It's magically enforced. If I don't deliver you by sundown, my mana core burns out. I die screaming."

Victor nodded. "Suicide clause. Crude, but effective. Whoever wrote your contract didn't trust you to stay bought."

"They were thorough."

"They were *sloppy*." Victor stepped closer, ignoring the renewed tension from the crossbows. "Every magical contract has loopholes. Especially Consortium-template bindings. Let me guess—you signed it without reading the appendix clauses?"

Kade hesitated. "...There were a lot of pages."

"Page seventeen. Section F. Subsection nine." Victor recited from memory—he'd written enough contracts to know the standard formats. "Transfer Clause. If the original employer dies, forfeits, or transfers the contract, it defaults to the highest-bidding third party. The binding doesn't break. It just... changes ownership."

Kade blinked. "Wait. You mean—"

"I mean I don't need to *break* your contract," Victor said. "I just need to *buy* it."

***

Barnaby watched from the driver's bench as his new boss negotiated with the man who'd been about to kidnap him five minutes ago.

"This is insane," Barnaby muttered.

Victor ignored him. He was focused on Kade.

"Here's the plan," Victor said. "You tell me who hired you. Not a contract violation—you're allowed to confirm target identity for mission verification. Then I leverage your employer into transferring the contract to me. You still complete your mission. You deliver me. Just... to myself."

Kade laughed. It was a bitter, exhausted sound. "You can't just *negotiate* your way out of an ambush."

"I've negotiated my way out of board coups, patent wars, and assassination attempts," Victor replied. "This is just Tuesday."

"Who the hell *are* you?"

"Someone who reads the fine print." Victor pulled a blank contract from his coat. "Now. Who hired you?"

Kade stared at the contract. At the vault. At his men, who were now openly whispering about the thirty-thousand-gold offer.

He sighed.

"Merchant Vex. Blackwood Trading Company. Operates out of the southern provinces."

Victor's eyes flashed gold. ARMI immediately began cross-referencing.

> **[ARMI Database Search]**
> **Entity:** Merchant Vex
> **Affiliation:** Blackwood Trading Company
> **Specialty:** Cross-border smuggling, luxury goods
> **Territory:** Southern trade routes
> **Intelligence:** Suspected Church of Eternal Light financier
> **Threat Level:** Moderate (Economic Competitor)

Victor's internal ledger clicked.

Vex wasn't a random merchant. He was a *proxy*.

"The Church," Victor said quietly. "Vex works for the Church."

Kade frowned. "How did you—"

"Timing." Victor tapped his notebook. "I executed a Galactic Exchange transaction eight hours ago. Hestia warned me the Church would trace the mana signature. Vex ambushes me twelve hours later. He's not reacting to what I've *done*. He's reacting to what I *could* do."

He closed the notebook.

"This is a pre-emptive strike. The Church wants me stopped before I flood their miracle market."

Kade looked uneasy. "You're saying I'm caught in a *religious war*?"

"No. You're caught in an *economic war*." Victor pulled out the obsidian Consortium card. "And I'm about to Escalate."

He opened the Galactic Exchange interface. Scrolled to the "Enforcement" category.

> **Listing #4452-Delta**
> **Item:** [Contract Override Token] (Single-Use)
> **Function:** Forces magical contract transfer to token holder
> **Price:** 5,000 GP
> **Seller:** Entity 'The Broker' (World 12-Q)

Victor purchased it without hesitation.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Transaction Complete.**
> **Balance:** 56,730 GP
> **Item:** [Contract Override Token] retrieved.

A small crystal chip materialized in Victor's hand. It pulsed with green light—the same color as Kade's binding sigil.

"What is that?" Kade asked.

"Your severance package." Victor pressed the chip to Kade's chest.

The binding sigil flared. Kade gasped. The green glow shifted—twisted—and reformed into a different pattern.

> **[System Alert]**
> **Contract Transfer: SUCCESSFUL**
> **New Employer:** Victor Kaine (Kaine Consulting, LLC)
> **Mission Updated:** Security Detail (The Gilded Caravan)
> **Salary:** 30,000 GP (Lump Sum) + 100 GP/month per soldier
> **Duration:** 6 months (Renewable)

Kade looked down at his chest. The sigil was still there. But the burning pressure—the threat of mana-core collapse—was gone.

"You... you just *bought* me."

"I bought your *contract*," Victor corrected. "You're an independent contractor now. With benefits."

Kade stood there, stunned.

His second-in-command, a scarred woman with a warhammer, stepped forward. "Boss? Did we just get hired by the guy we were supposed to kidnap?"

"Yes," Kade said faintly.

"...Can we get that in writing?"

Victor handed her a contract. Pre-signed.

She read it. Blinked. "This includes dental?"

"I'm not a savage," Victor said.

***

Twenty minutes later, the Gilded Caravan resumed its journey south. Now accompanied by forty-two armed sellswords.

Kade sat across from Victor inside the wagon, still processing. His fingers kept touching the binding sigil on his chest. The pressure was gone. The burning threat of mana-core failure—gone.

For the first time in three months, he could breathe without calculating his remaining hours.

"What's our first job?" he asked finally.

Victor didn't look up from his ledger. "We're going to visit Merchant Vex. And we're going to make him an offer."

"What kind of offer?"

"The kind where he either sells me his Church contacts, or I expose him as a proxy and watch every smuggler from here to Oakhaven blacklist him."

Kade laughed. It was genuine this time. "You're going to *destroy* him for sending us?"

"No," Victor said. "I'm going to *liquidate* him. Then absorb his market share."

Outside, Barnaby's voice drifted back through the dimensional fold: "Boss, you got ambushed and you *hired* the ambushers. Is this normal for you?"

"Extremely normal," Victor called back.

> **[ARMI]**
> **New Asset Acquired:** Kade's Company (42 Sellswords)
> **Average Level:** 12
> **Monthly Operating Cost:** 4,200 GP
> **Classification:** Security Contractor
> **Morale:** 78% (Confused but Satisfied)

Victor closed the ledger. Opened the Galactic Exchange.

An alert blinked.

> **[Listing Status Update]**
> **Item:** [Miracle: Rain]
> **Offer Received:** 45,000 GP (ANONYMOUS BUYER)
> **Message:** "Urgent delivery requested. Will pay DOUBLE for immediate transfer."

Victor stared at the message.

Someone wanted that miracle. Desperately.

Desperately enough to offer *ninety thousand gold*.

"Barnaby!" Victor shouted. "How fast can this wagon move?"

"Uh—pretty fast, Boss! Why?"

"We need to reach Oakhaven before someone else realizes what I'm selling."

The wagon lurched. Accelerated.

Victor watched the Exchange ticker scroll.

The buyer was still online. Still waiting.

And somewhere, the Church of Eternal Light was realizing they had a problem.

A problem named Victor Kaine.

Behind them, unnoticed, a raven took flight from the treeline. Its eyes glowed faintly green—the color of scrying magic.

Someone was still watching.
