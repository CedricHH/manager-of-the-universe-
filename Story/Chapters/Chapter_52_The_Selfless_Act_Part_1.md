# Chapter 52: The Selfless Act (Part 1)

Victor had seventy-two hours to prepare for a prince.

The Core Chamber hummed with activity. Sniv had commandeered one corner as a makeshift document station, scrolls and parchments spreading across the stone floor like a bureaucratic fungus. Asterion stood guard near the main entrance, his greataxe polished to a reflective shine, running security drills in his head. Nova projected revenue charts onto the cavern wall while Zip scurried between stations, delivering messages and collecting status reports.

It was, Victor reflected, the first time Insolvia Holdings had prepared for a *voluntary* audit.

> **[ARMI]**  
> Acquisition Protocol: Crown Prince Aldric  
> Time Remaining: 71 hours, 42 minutes  
> Preparation Status: 12% complete  
> Required Assets: Revenue documentation, operational showcases, strategic proposals  
> Probability of Success: Calculating...

Victor watched the probability field fluctuate. Normally, he would have intervened by now — adjusted variables, optimized outcomes, pushed the numbers higher. But today, his mind kept drifting.

This was the moment. The real acquisition. Not survival, not defense, not incremental gains. This was *expansion*. Crown-level expansion.

The last time he'd taken a risk this large...

The memory surfaced without warning.

**EARTH. SIX MONTHS AFTER PROJECT COBALT.**

The corner office was dark.

Victor sat behind his desk, illuminated only by the glow of a laptop screen and the distant constellation of city lights through floor-to-ceiling windows. The building was empty — no executives, no assistants, no security guards walking the halls. Just Victor and the silence of a corporate tower after midnight.

He wasn't CEO anymore. The board had stripped that title three months ago, buried him under the weight of carefully constructed headlines. **"EXECUTIVE RESIGNS AMID SUPPLY CHAIN SCANDAL."** They hadn't fired him. Firing meant lawsuits, discovery, questions. Instead, they'd created a position: "Senior Strategic Consultant." A title that meant nothing and paid everything.

The deal was simple. Victor stayed quiet. Victor took the money. Victor watched from the sidelines as the company continued exactly as before.

On his desk, illuminated by the laptop's glow, sat a folder. Thick. Dog-eared from repeated handling. The lawyers had sent it six months ago — a "courtesy notification" of ongoing litigation. Victor didn't need to open it. He'd memorized every page.

Forty-seven photographs. Forty-seven faces. Workers at the Congolese mine. Children at the nearby village. Families who drank from the river that the processing plant had poisoned.

Project Cobalt. The initiative that Victor had signed off on without reading the subcontractor reports. The supply chain optimization that had sourced materials from a facility that everyone *knew* was using illegal practices, because asking questions cost money and answering them cost more.

He hadn't known about the deaths. Not until the first lawsuit.

Victor told himself this every night. He played it on repeat, like a meditation mantra. *I didn't know. I couldn't have known. The board made the real decisions. I just signed orders.*

It was true. It was also irrelevant.

The company was still running. The board members were still in power. The supply chain was still "optimized" through the same channels, the same blind eyes, the same profitable ignorance.

And Victor Kaine, the man who had once prided himself on understanding every variable, every outcome probability, every ROI calculation — sat alone in the dark, wondering why the math wouldn't balance.

---

He'd been doing this for six months.

Not the sitting. The *auditing*.

Victor didn't believe in guilt. Guilt was an emotional response, and emotional responses were inefficient. They clouded judgment, distorted analysis, consumed cognitive resources that could be better allocated elsewhere.

But he did believe in math. And the math was wrong.

He pulled up the laptop. The spreadsheet filled the screen — rows and columns he'd been building for months, hidden behind three layers of encryption. Not company data. *Personal* data. His own private audit.

**Column A**: Future projects using similar supply chain methods.  
**Column B**: Estimated casualties per year if practices continue.  
**Column C**: Probability of detection and prosecution.  
**Column D**: Net present value of human cost.

The board had made it clear. Project Cobalt was an anomaly. A mistake. An isolated incident that would never be repeated.

They were lying.

Victor had cross-referenced their planned expansion into Southeast Asia. The same subcontractor networks. The same blind approvals. The same quarterly pressure to reduce costs by any means necessary.

The expected additional deaths over the next decade, if current practices continued: **~200**.

He stared at the number. It wasn't a guess. It was a calculation — the same type of calculation he'd made a thousand times before. Cost-benefit analysis. Risk assessment. Probability modeling.

The only difference was that the "cost" column contained human beings instead of capital expenditures.

Victor leaned back in his chair.

He had money. He had safety. He had silence. The board would continue paying him as long as he remained quiet, and he could remain quiet until he died of old age in some beachfront retirement home, forgotten by history.

Or.

He looked at the folder. The forty-seven faces.

The math was clear.

If he released the evidence — the emails, the financial records, the shell company documents, the payment receipts that proved the board knew *exactly* what they were funding — the company would burn. The executives would face criminal charges. Future projects would be scrutinized. Future deaths would be prevented.

The cost: His own life. That was also clear. The board had connections. Government connections. The kind that made people disappear.

Victor did the math. Personal survival probability if he stayed silent: 98% over the next thirty years. Personal survival probability if he released the evidence: ~15% over the next thirty days.

But the expected number of future deaths prevented: ~200.

He was always going to die eventually.

For the first time in his life, Victor Kaine made a decision that had negative ROI for himself.

He stood up. He walked to the door. He took the elevator to the basement.

The server room was waiting.

---

The basement hummed with the sound of cooling systems.

Victor's keycard granted him access — a legacy privilege the IT department hadn't bothered to revoke. He moved through the rows of server racks, their blinking lights casting blue shadows across his face. The main data terminal was in the back, hidden behind a forest of cables and redundant power supplies.

He'd been coming here for six months. Just for a few minutes at a time. Never long enough to trigger security alerts. Never obvious enough to attract attention.

Copy. Transfer. Encrypt. Delete the log.

The thumb drive in his pocket contained everything the lawyers needed. Every email chain. Every approval signature. Every wire transfer to the Congolese intermediaries. Every boardroom minute where someone had asked "but what if the working conditions are—" and been silenced.

This was the final download. The last piece of evidence. A series of encrypted communications between the CEO and a government official — the same official who had made the initial investigation into Project Cobalt "go away."

Victor plugged in the drive. The transfer began.

He didn't feel fear. That would be inefficient. He didn't feel righteousness. That would be presumptuous. He didn't even feel tired, despite the late hour and the months of stress.

He felt... nothing.

This was just math. Cold, clean, emotionless math. Two hundred lives versus one. The calculation made itself.

The progress bar crept forward. Fifty percent. Sixty.

Somewhere above, a door opened. Footsteps echoed through the basement — the heavy, regular stride of a security patrol making their rounds.

Victor worked faster.

**PRESENT DAY — TERRA-INSOLVIA**

"Boss? *Boss!*"

Victor's eyes snapped open. The Core Chamber. The dungeon. The crystalline pulse of Nova's light.

Sniv stood in front of him, clipboard clutched to his chest, oversized ears twitching with concern. The goblin's expression was the particular mixture of worry and confusion that Victor had come to recognize as Sniv's version of emotional distress.

"You okay, Boss? You had faraway-eyes. Like when Boss thinking about killing something, but *sad* killing. Sniv not know there was sad killing."

Victor blinked. His hands were trembling — a physiological response he couldn't immediately suppress. He gripped the edge of the stone table until the sensation passed.

The memory receded. The server room. The downloading files. The footsteps approaching.

He wasn't in that basement anymore. He wasn't on Earth. He was Victor Kaine of Insolvia Holdings, restructurer and asset manager, preparing to acquire a prince.

And yet.

> **[ARMI - PSYCHOLOGICAL AUDIT]**  
> Memory Integration Detected: Pre-reincarnation trauma event.  
> Classification: The Selfless Act (Archive)  
> Warning: Emotional processing inefficient. Recommend compartmentalization.  
> Note: The Galactic Audit Consortium selected you for that anomaly.  
> The decision in that server room.  
> The one that *didn't* calculate.

Victor dismissed the notification with a thought. But its words lingered.

*The one that didn't calculate.*

That night in the server room was the only time in Victor's life — his *first* life — that he'd made a decision purely for its own sake. Not for profit. Not for survival. Not for optimization.

He'd done it because it was *worth it*.

He still didn't have a better word for that feeling.

"I'm fine, Sniv." Victor straightened, smoothing the front of his jacket. "Just... remembering why I'm here."

The goblin looked uncertain. "Boss remembering... server room?"

"You don't—" Victor stopped. Frowned. "How do you know about the server room?"

Sniv shuffled nervously. "Boss talks in sleep sometimes. When Boss thinks no one listening. Sniv always listening. Sniv is HR. Listening is job."

For a long moment, Victor said nothing.

Then, unexpectedly, he laughed. A short, dry sound — the laugh of a man rediscovering that he was still capable of being surprised.

"Never change, Sniv."

"Sniv never change! Change is bad for employment stability!"

Victor shook his head. The memory was still there — the server room, the downloading files, the footsteps approaching — but it could wait. The rest of the story could wait.

He had a prince to prepare for.

And this time, when the risk paid off, he intended to be alive to see it.
