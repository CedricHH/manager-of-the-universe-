# Chapter 40: Guild Leverage

The Merchant Guild headquarters looked exactly like the law firms that had destroyed Victor's career on Earth—expensive architecture designed to intimidate, and paperwork designed to crush.

Three stories of carved limestone. Enchanted security wards humming at threshold detection levels. Window glass so perfectly clear it had to be magical enhancement. The building screamed institutional authority and the financial power to maintain it.

Victor carried a leather document case. Inside: ARMI-scanned evidence of sabotage, cost analysis spreadsheets, profit margin comparisons, and market impact projections. Everything documented to litigation-grade standards.

Elena Cross met him at the main entrance, professional smile in place.

"Mr. Kaine. Punctual." She gestured toward the interior. "The Council is... curious. Nothing kills a monopoly faster than documentation. And nothing protects you better than making the Guild money."

Victor adjusted his grip on the case. "So this isn't about justice."

"This is about leverage," Elena said. "Which you have. Use it wisely."

She led him through marble hallways past clerks processing trade contracts and merchants arguing shipping disputes. The Guild ran like a well-oiled machine—bureaucratic, profitable, and entirely amoral.

Perfect.

The Council Chamber occupied the entire third floor.

Five high-backed chairs arranged in a semicircle. Five senior merchants—gray hair, expensive robes, the kinds of faces that had negotiated thousands of contracts and felt nothing resembling compassion.

Victor recognized the setup instantly: Corporate board room dynamics. The chairs positioned to create psychological pressure. The elevated platform to establish dominance. The single chair facing the semicircle—his chair—placed deliberately lower.

He'd sat in rooms like this on Earth. Usually on the semicircle side.

Elena took her seat on the left. The center chair belonged to a heavyset man with a Guild Councilor's chain—Thoren Blackwood, if Victor's pre-meeting research was correct.

Blackwood gestured to the lone chair. "Mr. Kaine. Please."

Victor sat, opened his document case, and pulled out organized folders. He arranged them on the small table in front of him with methodical precision.

"Gentlemen. Lady Cross." Victor met each Council member's eyes. "Thank you for your time. I understand it's valuable."

"We read your initial report," Blackwood said. "Impressive documentation quality. Were you an auditor in a previous life?"

"Corporate restructuring," Victor replied. Truth disguised as vague answer.

One of the other Councilors—a thin woman with sharp features, nameplate reading "Maris Vex"—leaned forward. "Your stall was destroyed less than eighteen hours after you undercut Cartel pricing. Allegedly."

"Not allegedly." Victor opened the first folder. "Documented sabotage. Timestamped ARMI environmental scans, damage assessment, written threat photographed at scene, witness testimony from four independent merchants who heard suspicious activity at 2 AM."

He passed copies around the semicircle.

Thoren Blackwood studied the images—shattered potion vials, splintered wood, the painted warning: LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN.

He laughed.

Actual laughter. Deep and genuine.

"Amateur hour," Blackwood said. "The Cartel's gotten sloppy. Ten years ago they'd have made it look like an accident."

"Monopolies breed complacency," Victor agreed. "When you control 87% of a market for decades, you stop innovating. Including your intimidation tactics."

Maris Vex tapped one of the cost analysis sheets. "You claim 250% markup on your potions. The Cartel operates at 650%. Show me how your margins are sustainable."

Victor pulled out a second folder—supply chain documentation.

"My production costs are 2 Gold Pieces per standard health potion. That includes raw materials, labor, quality control, and shipping." He pointed to the itemized breakdown. "I sell at 5 GP retail. That's 3 GP profit per unit, 60% margin on gross revenue."

"The Cartel's production costs are similar," Victor continued. "But they charge 15 GP because they can. No competition. No market pressure. Pure extraction."

Another Councilor—middle-aged man, scarred hands suggesting ex-adventurer background—spoke up. "What's your supply capacity?"

"Currently? 200 potions weekly. Within one month? 500. Within three months?" Victor smiled slightly. "However many the market demands. My supply chain scales."

That got their attention.

> **[ARMI - NEGOTIATION ANALYSIS]**  
> Council Interest Level: 87% (High)  
> Primary Motivation: Profit (72%), Power Disruption (21%), Justice (7%)  
> Leverage Assessment: STRONG  
> Recommendation: Request operational protection + market exclusivity clause  

Elena Cross leaned back in her chair, watching Victor with professional curiosity. She'd already seen his documentation quality. Now she was watching him negotiate.

"So," Blackwood said slowly, "you can supply volume. You have evidence of Cartel criminal activity. You're offering competitive pricing that benefits our merchant members who need potion inventory." He steepled his fingers. "What do you want from the Guild?"

"Protection," Victor said bluntly. "Security detail assigned to my operations. Legal support if the Cartel escalates. Fast-tracked merchant certification so I operate with full institutional legitimacy."

"And in exchange?"

"I supply Guild-affiliated merchants with wholesale potions at cost plus 20%. The Guild takes a commission on my retail sales." Victor met Blackwood's eyes. "Mutually beneficial partnership. I get infrastructure. You get profit and market disruption of a corrupt monopoly."

"Fifteen percent commission," Maris Vex said immediately.

"Ten percent," Victor countered.

Elena's voice cut in, calm and professional. "You were sabotaged in twelve hours, Mr. Kaine. Without Guild protection, you'll be dead in forty-eight. The Cartel doesn't stop at property damage."

"Without my supply," Victor replied, "your members will keep paying Cartel prices. And your Guild will keep watching them bleed profit to an extractive monopoly." He glanced at his documentation. "Ten percent is fair value for mutual benefit."

Silence.

The Council members exchanged glances. Some kind of nonverbal communication Victor couldn't quite read.

Blackwood spoke. "Twelve percent commission. Guild censure for any member who sabotages your operations—that's enforceable punishment, loss of membership if violated. Security detail of two ex-adventurer guards, Level 12 minimum. Legal representation if Cartel files formal challenges."

He leaned forward. "And you provide us with quarterly reports on Cartel market share loss. We want to watch them bleed."

Victor considered. Lost 2% on commission but gained institutional backing, legal protection, and Council investment in his success.

ROI: Positive.

"Agreed," Victor said.

One of the previously silent Councilors—older man, silver beard—spoke for the first time. "The Cartel's been untouchable for years. They have Church connections, nobility contracts, leverage in the Adventurer's Guild." He smiled grimly. "Monopolies always think they're untouchable. Then someone with evidence shows up, and the whole house burns down."

Victor felt something tighten in his chest.

Victor blinked. Refocused.

The Council was watching him.

Elena's voice, careful: "Mr. Kaine? Are we agreed?"

"Yes," Victor said. "Twelve percent commission. Formal contract."

He signed the documents Blackwood slid across the table. Professional letterhead. Binding terms. Institutional protection purchased with profit-sharing and documented evidence.

The Alchemist Cartel was just another corrupt monopoly.

And Victor knew exactly how to burn them down.

Some fires were worth starting.

---

Victor left the Guild headquarters with two new employees.

Kael and Mira—ex-adventurers, both Level 12, hired as security detail by Guild contract. Kael carried a sword and professional paranoia. Mira specialized in detection magic and threat assessment.

"Orders, sir?" Kael asked as they descended the Guild steps.

"Stay close. Watch for—"

Zip came sprinting around the corner, ears flat against his head, eyes wide with panic.

"Boss! Boss! Big fire! Market stalls burning!"

Victor's hand went to his ARMI interface. Environmental scan activated.

> **[ARMI - EMERGENCY SCAN: MARKET SQUARE]**  
> Fire Detected: Sector 4-C (3 stalls)  
> Heat Signature: 800°C (active blaze)  
> Affected Structures: 2 independent merchants + 1 Alchemist Cartel stall  
> Casualty Status: 0 fatalities, 4 injuries (smoke inhalation)  
> Cause Assessment: 73% probability accelerant used, 18% probability accidental, 9% probability magical  

Smoke rose from the market square three blocks away. People screaming. City guards running toward the blaze.

Victor processed the data.

Three stalls. One was Cartel-owned.

"Was it sabotage?" Mira asked, hand on her spell focus.

"Probability suggests intentional fire," Victor said. "Question is whether the Cartel meant to burn their own stall."

Kael frowned. "Why would they?"

"They wouldn't." Victor watched the smoke billow. "Which means their hired arsonists got sloppy. Tried to burn more independent merchants, lost control, caught their own property in the blaze."

Zip's ears perked up. "Cartel make acci—accident?"

"Cartel made a mistake," Victor corrected. "A very useful mistake."

The crowd's reaction was already shifting. Street vendors shouting about "Cartel retaliation gone wrong!" Merchants pointing at the burning Cartel stall. Public perception crystallizing in real-time: The Alchemist Cartel had tried to burn out competition and destroyed their own infrastructure instead.

> **[ARMI - MARKET IMPACT PROJECTION]**  
> Public Opinion Shift: 67% now view Cartel as dangerous/reckless  
> Probability of City Investigation: 91%  
> Probability of Guild Arbitration Escalation: 94%  
> Probability Victor's Evidence Becomes Criminal Exhibit: 89%  
> Optimal Action: Provide documentation to authorities immediately  

Victor pulled out his comm-crystal and messaged Elena:

**Victor → Elena**: "The market's burning. I assume the Council will investigate who's responsible for 'accidental' arson?"

Response came within seconds.

**Elena → Victor**: "Already mobilizing. This just became a criminal matter. Your evidence package is now Exhibit A. Guards en route to secure scene. Well played."

**Victor → Elena**: "I didn't play anything. I just documented what happened."

**Elena → Victor**: "Exactly."

Victor pocketed the crystal.

Kael and Mira stood ready, watching their new employer with professional assessment.

"Sir," Kael said carefully, "you just signed a Guild contract an hour ago. And now the Cartel's burning their own reputation along with the market."

"Coincidence," Victor replied.

Mira's detection magic flickered around her eyes—truth-sensing enchantment. She studied Victor for three seconds.

Then smiled slightly. "Of course. Coincidence."

Victor watched the Cartel's stall collapse in flames. Watched city guards cordon off the area. Watched merchants gather in angry clusters, pointing at the Cartel's other market locations.

The fire would burn out within the hour.

The damage to the Cartel's reputation would burn much longer.

---

Zip tugged on Victor's sleeve. "Boss... we go help?"

"No." Victor turned away from the growing crowd. "We go prepare inventory. Tomorrow I'll have two hundred potions ready for sale. And the Cartel will be too busy dealing with criminal investigations to stop me."

He gestured to Kael and Mira. "Secure the inn. I want perimeter watch on four-hour rotations. The Cartel's desperate now. Desperate opponents make fatal mistakes, but they also make violent ones."

"Understood," Kael said.

They walked back toward The Silver Standard while the market square burned behind them.

Victor's ARMI calculated probabilities, projected market share shifts, estimated the Cartel's remaining political capital.

The numbers were excellent.

Within two weeks, he'd control 30% of Oakhaven's potion market. Within a month, 50%. The Cartel would retaliate—lawsuits, political pressure, possibly more violence—but they'd already made their critical error.

They'd underestimated documentation.

Just like the board that betrayed Victor on Earth.

And just like that board, the Alchemist Cartel was about to learn a simple truth:

Victor Kaine didn't start fights.

He finished them.

With evidence, leverage, and institutional backing.

And he always kept receipts.
