# Chapter 85: The Decompression Protocol

The bio-luminescent flora of the Spire Gardens turned a violent, warning shade of crimson. The ground beneath the floating obsidian platforms shuddered, sending ripples through the mana-fountains and causing expensive wine to spill onto even more expensive silk.

Governor Malphas stood with his hand pressed against a floating runic podium, his face twisted into a rictus of desperate triumph.

"You pushed the market too hard, Kaine!" Malphas roared, his voice amplified by the rising mana-storm. "Clause 44-B is active! The stabilizers in the Grey Spires are decoupling. In three minutes, the northern ridge will be nothing but a crater and a memory. Withdraw your claim, or we all lose!"

The High Council members were screaming now, abandoning their dignity in a frantic scramble toward the teleportation pads. Lord Aris was clawing at a locked rune-gate, screaming offers of ten, twenty, fifty thousand gold pieces to a teleportation-clerk who wasn't listening. Lady Valis had collapsed onto a bench, clutching her necklace as if the jewels could shield her from a thermal detonation. Panic, unlike the bond market, was immediate, universal, and entirely unhedged.

Victor Kaine didn't move. He stood amidst the chaos, one hand casually in his pocket, the other adjusting the holographic ARMI interface that hovered before him. The red light of the impending explosion reflected in his eyes, but it didn't look like fire. It looked like opportunity.

"Silas," Victor said, his voice cutting through the noise via a comms-earpiece. "Status."

*"It’s... it’s spiking, sir!"* Silas’s voice crackled, terrified but functioning. *"The mana-pressure in the Spires is rising exponentially. The market algorithms are reading it as total asset destruction. The value of Syndicate bonds effectively hit zero three seconds ago."*

"Good," Victor said. "That puts them within budget."

"Are you insane?" Thaddeus Vane hissed, stepping up beside him. The Senior Partner’s monocle was flashing with red warning runes. "He’s initiated a thermal runaway, Victor. You can't audit an explosion."

"You can if you own the bomb, Thaddeus," Victor replied. He turned to the Duke, who was watching the destruction with the manic glee of a man who had chosen mutual destruction over bankruptcy.

"You can't stop it!" Malphas laughed. "The sequence is hard-coded into the ownership runestones! As long as I am Governor, the mountains obey me!"

"Precisely," Victor noted. "As long as you are Governor."

"Now, Mina," Victor commanded.

In the cramped, coffee-stained office of the Bureau of Imperial Audit, the air was thick with the smell of burnt ozone and panic sweat.

Mina stared at the projection of the frantic market. Her finger hovered over the 'Execute' rune on her terminal. The glass of her desk was vibrating from the sheer magical feedback of the crashing northern network.

"The yield is negative," Silas shouted from his station, his glasses sliding down his nose as he frantically routed mana-streams. "The price is dropping so fast the ticker can't even render the numbers! It’s not just a crash, Mina. It’s a singularity!"

"Victor said buy the dip," Mina whispered, her hand trembling. "He said wait for the zero."

"It’s at zero!" Silas screamed. "The Syndicate is gone! If you buy it now, you’re buying a crater!"

Mina closed her eyes. She remembered the look on Victor’s face when he shorted the market. The absolute, terrifying certainty. She didn't trust the market. She didn't trust the Empire. But she trusted the Chainsaw.

She slammed her hand down on the 'Execute' rune.

The air around Malphas shimmered. The runic podium he was holding suddenly turned cold. The connection—the magical tether that bound his will to the distant mines—snapped with a sound like a breaking violin string.

Malphas stumbled back, staring at his hands. "What... what did you do?"

"I bought the dip," Victor said.

He tapped a sequence into his interface. "The Grey Spires are no longer the property of the Onyx Syndicate. They are now the wholly-owned subsidiary of Insolvia Integrated Extraction. And as the new CEO, I’m cancelling the demolition order."

"It’s too late!" Malphas screamed. "The pressure is already critical! You can't just turn off a mana-void!"

"No," Victor agreed, watching the red mana-lightning arc between the floating platforms. "But you can restructure it."

He raised his hand. The ARMI interface expanded, projecting a massive golden grid over the chaos.

"Skill: **[Asset Liquidation]**."

> **[ARMI]**
> Target: Excess Mana Volatility [Grey Spires]
> Action: CONVERT > CURRENCY
> Conversion Rate: High-Risk Premium applied.

"Decompress," Victor whispered.

The roaring sound of the building explosion shifted. It didn't stop—it *changed*. The raw, destructive mana that was building up in the northern lay-lines was suddenly seized by the System. It wasn't destroyed; it was monetized.

The crimson light in the garden began to drain away, sucked into a vortex above Victor’s head. But instead of darkness, the vortex began to rain.

Gold.

Not physical coins, but shimmering, translucent golden data-streams that flowed directly into Victor’s interface. The "explosion" was being siphoned off, converted from kinetic energy into economic value.

"Volatility is just energy without a price tag," Victor said, his voice amplified by the golden storm swirling around him. He reached out and let the data-stream wash over his hand. It felt warm, like fresh-minted coins, but light as air. "And I am pricing it."

The sensation was intoxicating. Victor felt his ARMI account swelling, the numbers ticking up so fast they blurred into a solid bar of white light. He wasn't just rich; he was effectively channeling the GDP of a small nation through his veins. For a brief second, he understood why dragons hoarded gold. It wasn't about greed. It was about *power*. The sheer, raw potential of liquid assets.

The shaking stopped. The red warning lights faded back to the gentle, bioluminescent pulse of the garden flora. The silence that followed was deafening, broken only by the soft *chime* of Victor’s account settling.

Victor staggered slightly, clutching the railing of the platform. His veins felt heavy, as if liquid lead had replaced his blood. He tasted copper and expensive vintage wine—a side effect of processing too much value too quickly. He took a steadying breath, forcing his heart rate to align with the new balance in his ledger.

Malphas stood frozen, his hand still outstretched toward a podium that no longer recognized him. He looked small. Defeated. And, for the first time, utterly bankrupt.

"That..." Malphas whispered. "That’s impossible. You turned a catastrophe into..."

"Profit," Victor finished. "It’s called arbitration, Governor. Learn it."

The sound of heavy boots broke the spell. Imperial Guards, summoned by Vane’s silent alarm, surrounded the platform. Vane stepped forward, his face composed, though his monocle was still processing the sheer impossibility of what he had just witnessed.

"Governor Malphas," Vane announced, his voice dry and official. "You are under arrest for the attempted destruction of Imperial Property. Specifically, the destruction of *this* Imperial Property."

He gestured to Victor.

"That property was mine!" Malphas shrieked as the guards grabbed him. "It was my right! My legacy!"

"It was a distressed asset," Victor corrected, dusting an imaginary speck of mana-dust from his lapel. "And you were the liability."

As Malphas was dragged away, screaming about lawyers and blood-rights, the High Council members slowly merged from their cover. They looked at Victor with a mixture of terror and awe. He hadn't just saved them; he had turned a death sentence into a line item.

Hestia stepped through the crowd. She wasn't shaken. If anything, she looked exhilarated. Her silver eyes were wide, reflecting the lingering golden light of the conversion.

"Controlled decompression," she murmured, stopping inches from Victor. "You didn't just stop the explosion. You embezzled it."

"I prefer 'resource recovery'," Victor said. "Waste is a sin, Senior Partner. Even energetic waste."

Hestia smiled. It was a genuine smile this time—the smile of a predator that had found a mate. "You are dangerous, Victor Kaine. Thaddeus was right to recruit you. But you’re too big for the North. The Grey Spires? That was a tutorial."

She reached into her silk jacket and pulled out a black envelope sealed with a sigil Victor didn't recognize. It wasn't the Imperial Crest. It was a geometric eye—the symbol of the Galactic Audit Consortium.

"The Bureau has... other interests," Hestia said, pressing the envelope into his hand. Her fingers lingered on the seal, her expression shifting from amusement to something sharper, colder. "Interests that require someone who understands that reality is just another form of currency. We have enough auditors who can count beans, Victor. I think we finally found one who can count worlds. Read this. Then tell me if you're ready to stop playing with mines and start managing the cosmos."

Victor looked down at the envelope. His ARMI interface pulsed with a new notification.

> **[ARMI]**
> New Quest Available: [The Macro-Management]
> Source: Senior Partner Hestia [Agent of the G.A.C.]
> Difficulty: IMPOSSIBLE

Victor looked up, meeting Hestia’s gaze. He slipped the envelope into his new, deeper pocket.

"Calculated risk," Victor said. "I’m listening."

Final Line: "Why settle for a province, Hestia? I’ve always preferred a global market."
