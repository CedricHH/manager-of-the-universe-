# Chapter 15: The Roar

Victor sat on a crate in the entrance hall, watching the sunlight crawl across the stone. It was a beautiful morning outside—birds singing, air smelling of pine—the kind of day that made you happy to be alive.

Victor hated it.

He checked his mental clock. Day Seven. The final day.

Asterion’s extension—granted with a terrifying lack of negotiation—expired at sundown.

"Resources," Victor muttered, rubbing his temples. He hadn't slept in thirty hours; the mana fatigue from surveillance was beginning to feel like a migraine.

Sniv, who was currently organizing a pile of rocks near the entrance (part of the new 'rustic aesthetic' Victor was trying), scrambled over. "Boss needs report?"

"Go ahead, Sniv. Tell me the bad news."

"Goblins ready. Twenty-six. Sharp sticks. Four iron swords. One shield." Sniv held up his fingers, counting through them. "Food... okay for two days. Gold... three coins from scared humans yesterday."

"Net worth: Fifty gold pieces, maybe," Victor sighed. "And that's if we liquidate everything, including the furniture."

It wasn't enough. Asterion didn't want fifty gold. He wanted *tribute*. He wanted something that proved this Dungeon Core was worth keeping active.

Victor looked at the entrance. The trap was set. The bait—Marcus’s glowing sword—was polished and pulsating with magical allure on Floor Three. The actors (goblins) were in position. The lighting was perfect.

All they needed was an audience.

"If no one comes," Victor said, more to himself than the goblin, "we have two choices. We fight a Level 32 Minotaur with sharp sticks, or we run."

"Running means leaving the Core," Victor pointed out. "If we leave the Core, we lose our jobs. And in this economy, 'unemployed dungeon manager' looks terrible on a resume."

He stood up, pacing the small area he’d cleared of rubble. He felt like a store manager on Black Friday, waiting for the doors to open, praying that the mob would actually show up.

"Come on," he whispered, staring at the patch of sunlight. "Jace and Mira. You ran away screaming. You must have told someone. Where are the heroes? Where are the greedy looters?"

As if on cue, a blue screen flickered into existence in front of his eyes.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Event**: Perimeter Activity Detected.
> **Entities**: 4
> **Classification**: Adventurer Party (Mid-Level)
> **Threat Assessment**: High

Victor’s internal risk monitor spiked. He tapped the screen, expanding the feed from the external sensors (actually unsuspecting beetles he’d tagged with mana).

Four figures were walking up the overgrown path to the ruin.

"Jackpot," Victor breathed.

***

They were nothing like Jace and Mira.

Where the two teenagers had stumbled and hesitated, this group moved with a fluid, predatory grace. They walked in a standard diamond formation—Tank in front, Healer in the middle, DPS (Damage Per Second) on the flanks.

Victor analyzed them from his perch in the ventilation shaft.

**The Tank (Gareth)**: A human male, late twenties. Heavy plate armor that actually fit. A tower shield with the symbol of a silver lance painted on it. Level 12, according to ARMI’s analysis.

**The Healer (Lysa)**: An elf female. Robes that were clean and practical. A staff that glowed with genuine holy energy, not just ambient mana. Level 10.

**The Rogue (Finn)**: Halfling male. Dual daggers. He wasn't walking; he was practically floating over the dry leaves. Level 11.

**The Mage (Kaelie)**: A human female with a staff topped by a red crystal. Fire mage. Level 13.

"Silver Lance," Sniv whispered, peeking over Victor's shoulder. "Shiny."

"Professional," Victor corrected. "Look at them. They're checking corners. They're watching the treeline. They aren't scared; they're working."

Step one: The Entrance.

Gareth stopped at the threshold, looking at the skull on the spike. He poked it with his sword.

"Fresh," he grunted. "Scavengers haven't touched it."

"Goblins?" the Mage asked. Her voice was bored, professional.

"Tracks say yes," Finn noted, crouching by the dirt. "Dozens of them. Small prints. But look at this heel mark here. Boot. Human. Someone was running."

"The kids," Gareth said. "Jace and Mira. Said they barely got out alive."

"Kids get scare easily," the Mage scoffed. "Probably saw a rat and panicked."

"Maybe," Gareth said. "But the mana reading is real. Lysa?"

The elf raised her staff. "I sense it. Deep. Floor Three, maybe Four. It's... throbbing. Like a heartbeat."

"Powerful artifact," the Mage agreed, licking her lips. "Worth the trip."

Victor grinned. *Hook, line, and sinker.*

"Alright, people," Victor whispered to the goblin relay team. "Standard package is a no-go. These guys will eat the 'scaring' tactics for breakfast. We need to let them feel superior. Let them win... until they're deep enough that they can't leave."

He gestured to Sniv. "Pull everyone back to Floor Two. Clear the entrance traps. If they spot the amateur pressure plate, they'll think the whole place is a joke. I want them confident."

***

The Silver Lance swept through Floor One like a cleaning crew.

They didn't trigger a single trap. Finn spotted the tripwires before he was even within ten feet of them. He disarmed them with a casual flick of his wrist, tossing the mechanisms aside like trash.

"Crude," the halfling muttered. "Goblin make. Not even hidden well."

"Focus," Gareth ordered. "Eyes up."

They reached the stairs to Floor Two. The darkness below was absolute.

"Light," the Mage commanded. A ball of magical flame erupted from her staff, hovering over her head. It was brighter than any torch, casting harsh shadows against the damp walls.

Victor winced. That light was going to ruin the atmosphere.

"Floor Two," Victor signaled. "Engage Scheme B. Hit and run. DO NOT ENGAGE DIRECTLY. Repeat: Do not engage."

The party descended.

Floor Two was where Victor had invested his "production budget." The mushrooms, the sounds, the shadows.

It didn't work.

"Illusion," the Mage announced, waving her hand through a patch of unnatural shadow. "Simple fear aura. Ignore it."

"Movement left," Gareth barked. He raised his shield just as Labor-15 (who had gotten a bit too enthusiastic) tried to drop a rock on them.

The rock bounced harmlessly off the shield. Gareth didn't even flinch. He thrust his sword out—a lightning-fast jab that would have skewered the goblin if Labor-15 hadn't slipped on a patch of moss.

"Scatters!" Gareth yelled. "Don't break formation!"

The goblins, realizing that their 'scary monster' routine was failing, scattered for real.

Victor watched, chewing his lip. This was the difference between amateurs and pros. Fear didn't work on pros. Only greed worked on pros.

"Let them through," Victor ordered. "Open the path to Floor Three. Let them see the prize."

The party pushed forward, slaughtering the few slimes that got in their way with efficient, brutal strokes. They reached the stairs to Floor Three.

And there it was.

The pulsing orange light. The hum of power. The Hero's sword, embedded in the stone like Excalibur waiting for a king.

The Silver Lance stopped. Even the bored Mage looked impressed.

"Jackpot," Finn whispered, echoing Victor's earlier sentiment.

"Careful," Gareth warned. "Boss room?"

"Empty," Finn reported, scanning the shadows. "I see... nothing. No traps. No ambush points. Just the sword."

"It's a bait," the Mage said. "Obviously."

"Maybe," Gareth said. "But is it worth it?"

He stepped forward. The air grew warmer. The orange pulse synchronized with their heartbeats. It was a masterpiece of magical allure, powered by the Core itself.

"Check it, Kaelie," Gareth ordered.

The Mage stepped forward. She didn't reach for the sword. Instead, she pulled a monocle from her pouch—a Lens of Identification—and held it up to her eye.

Victor held his breath. This was the moment. If they liked what they saw, they would take it. They would carry it out. And they would tell the world that this dungeon had *Tier 3 loot*.

Kaelie squinted. Mana swirled around the lens.

"Well?" Finn asked, bouncing on his heels. "Is it +2? +3? Fire damage?"

Kaelie lowered the lens. She frowned.

"It's... garbage," she said.

Victor froze. *What?*

"What do you mean?" Gareth asked.

"It's a sentient weapon," Kaelie explained, consulting the magical readout only she could see. "Soulbound. It has a 'Loyalty' requirement. If you aren't the original owner, it weighs a ton and screams insults at you."

"Insults?" Finn asked.

"Apparently it has a personality module set to 'Cranky Old Man'," Kaelie said, disgusted. "And... wait. The enchantment isn't combat-based. It's... cosmetic? 'Glow of Heroism'? It just glows? That's it?"

"Useless," Gareth spat. "Can we sell it?"

"Maybe to a collector," Kaelie shrugged. "But the 'Soulbound' curse means we can't even pick it up without passing a Willpower check. It's a cursed paperweight, Gareth."

Silence in the chamber.

Victor felt his stomach drop. Error in asset valuation. The dead hero was a vanity build; of course his sword was a cosmetic prop.

"Waste of time," Finn kicked a pebble. "Establishment is a joke. Level 1 goblins and a glow-stick sword. Let's bail."

"Agreed," Gareth nodded. He turned his back on the sword. "Let's head back to town. Maybe the East Woods have better spawns."

They turned around. They were leaving.

"Client retention failure," Victor whispered. "No. The funnel isn't closed. You can't leave. You have to take it."

If they left now, they would tell everyone the dungeon was a bust. 'Don't bother, it's just trash loot.' That was worse than being unknown. That was being *bad*.

"Sniv!" Victor hissed into the relay pipe. "Do something! Throw a rock! Insult their mothers! Keep them here!"

"Sniv trying!" the voice came back, panic-stricken. "But they have metal skins! Goblins scared!"

The adventurers were walking away. They were halfway to the stairs.

The deadline was tonight. If they walked out that door, Victor was dead.

"Think," Victor commanded himself. "Think like a Manager. The product failed. The customer is walking. You need a retention offer. You need... you need a Manager Override."

He didn't have one. He had no authority, no power, no—

**BOOM.**

The entire dungeon lurched. Dust rained from the ceiling. A deep, resonant vibration shook the floorplates, knocking Finn off his feet.

"Earthquake?" Gareth yelled, raising his shield.

"No," Kaelie shouted, her eyes wide. "Mana spike! Massive! Coming from below!"

**BOOM.**

Another step. Heavier this time. It wasn't the earth moving. It was something *walking*.

From the dark staircase leading down to Floor Four—the forbidden zone, the area Victor hadn't dared to enter—a sound erupted.

It wasn't a scream. It wasn't a growl. It was a decree.

**"WHO..."**

The voice was so deep it rattled Victor's teeth. It sounded like two tectonic plates grinding together.

**"WHO DISTURBS MY SLUMBER?"**

The Silver Lance party froze. Their professional veneer cracked instantly.

"What tier is that?" Finn squeaked.

"Above us," Kaelie whispered. She was pale. "Way above us. That's... that's a Boss. A real Boss."

Technically, Asterion was a Floor Boss, but to a Level 12 party, the distinction was academic.

**"I SMELL..."**

A massive hand, covered in tawny fur, gripped the edge of the stairwell. Stone crumbled under the grip. Then, horns. Curved, massive, and scarred.

Asterion pulled himself up.

He was huge. In the confined space of the dungeon, he looked like a titan. Eight feet of muscle, fur, and rage. He wore simple loincloths and iron bracers, but his presence filled the room like a gas leak.

He looked at the adventurers. His bovine eyes burned with a red, unnatural light.

**"Topside Meat,"** Asterion rumbled. **"Where is my Manager?"**

Gareth didn't answer. He didn't negotiate. He did the only sensible thing a veteran adventurer does when facing a skull-level threat in a newbie dungeon.

"RUN!"

"Scatter!" Finn screamed.

"Disengage!" Kaelie yelled, throwing a flashbang spell at the Minotaur's feet.

The party turned and sprinted. They didn't check corners. They didn't float. They scrambled, tripping over each other in a desperate dash for the exit.

Asterion roared again—a sound of pure frustration—but he didn't pursue. He watched them go, snorting a cloud of steam from his nostrils.

Then, he turned his head slowly, scanning the shadows of Floor Three.

**"Manager,"** he rumbled. **"The clock strikes."**

Victor, hidden in the ventilation shaft, registered a level of terror that his logical mind struggled to quantify.

The adventurers were gone. They had fled in terror.

Good news: They now knew there was a Boss here. A real, terrifying Boss. That would bring the elite parties.
Bad news: Asterion was awake. And he was hungry.

Victor looked at his trembling hands.

He could run. He could chase the adventurers, beg for mercy, maybe get arrested by the Guard. Prison was safer than this.

But then he looked at Sniv, huddled in the corner of the shaft, shaking like a leaf. He looked at the dungeon—this broken, dusty, beautiful mess of a startup he had built from nothing over the last week.

"I’m not quitting," Victor whispered.

"Boss?" Sniv squeaked.

"I'm not quitting," Victor said, louder. He straightened his tie—which was ridiculous, he was wearing a tattered shirt, but the motion was important.

He kicked the grate open.

**"I'm here!"** Victor shouted, his voice echoing in the chamber.

Asterion looked up. The giant bull-man narrowed his eyes.

Victor dropped from the vent, landing in a crouch (a devastatingly poor imitation of Labor-15's earlier move). He stood up, dusted off his knees, and walked toward the Minotaur.

He was unarmed. He was Level 1. He was a human in a world of monsters.

But he was the Manager.

"You're early," Victor said, his voice trembling only slightly. "We had until sundown."

Asterion huffed. He took a step forward, towering over Victor. The smell of musk and ozone was overpowering.

**"Sunset is a suggestion,"** Asterion rumbled. **"Hunger is a command. Where is my tribute, little Manager? Where is the gold? Where is the meat?"**

Victor looked at the empty room. The useless glowing sword. The scattered rocks.

He looked up at the Minotaur.

"I don't have it," Victor said.

Asterion's hand moved to the massive axe strapped to his back.

"But," Victor added quickly, raising a finger. "I have something better."

Asterion paused. His eyes narrowed.

**"Better than gold?"**

"Better than gold," Victor promised, praying his 'Sales Pitch' skill—if he ever unlocked one—was working. "I have a business plan."

Asterion stared at him. For a long, agonizing minute, the monster didn't move. Then, he threw his head back and laughed—a hacking, terrifying sound.

**"A business plan,"** Asterion mocked. **"You humans. You think words fill bellies."**

He leaned down, his face inches from Victor's.

**"Talk, Manager. Talk fast. Because right now, you look very... tender."**

Victor swallowed hard.

The pitch meeting from hell had officially begun.
