# Chapter 20: The Aftermath (Part 3)

The mud pit on Floor 3 was performing above expectations.

Step one: Finn the Rogue spotted the tripwire.
Step two: Finn disarmed the tripwire with a smug grin.
Step three: The tripwire was a decoy. The real trigger was the pressure plate he stepped on to reach it.
Step four: *Splat*.

Victor watched through the scrying link as the Halfling vanished into waist-deep, viscous clay.

"Movement impaired," Victor noted, narrating for Sniv's benefit. "Stamina drain initiated. Dignity reduced by forty percent."

On the screen, the rest of the party scrambled.
Bron, the new Berserker, laughed. He was a massive man, shirtless despite the dungeon dampness, wielding a hammer that looked like an engine block on a stick.
"Little man play in mud!" Bron roared, reaching in to haul Finn out by his collar.

"Careful," hissed the woman in white robes. **Sister Alara**. A Paladin of the Sun. Level 15. The highest threat on the board.
She scanned the corridor, her eyes glowing with a detection skill.
"No spikes," she murmured. "No poison. Just... mud?"

"Maybe the Dungeon Core is broken," suggested Gareth, the Tank. "Or stupid."

"Or it's toying with us," said Kaelie, the Mage. She ignited a fireball in her palm, illuminating the gloom. "I don't like it. Traps usually try to kill you. These are just trying to... annoy us."

Victor leaned back on his throne.
"Annoyance causes mistakes," he whispered. "Mistakes cause opportunities."

They moved forward.
The swinging log caught Bron in the chest. It didn't break ribs—his Constitution was too high—but it knocked the wind out of him.
The sleep darts bounced off Gareth's plate armor but nicked Kaelie's arm. She swayed, shaking her head to clear the drowsiness.

"Healer!" Gareth barked.
Alara cast [Cleanse]. The drowsiness vanished.

"They're efficient," Victor admitted. "But they're burning mana. Every [Cleanse] is a spell slot not used for [Smite]."

The party reached the stairs to the Fourth Floor.
The boundary line.
Beyond those stairs lay the Boss Room. Asterion.

Victor hesitated.
The Silver Lance was strong. With the new recruits, they might actually stand a chance against the Minotaur.
If they killed Asterion, the dungeon would be "cleared." Victor would lose his General. His deterrent.
If Asterion killed them... well, Victor fulfilled his contract. "Worthy opponents" delivered.

But Asterion had asked for a fight. Not a slaughter.

Victor closed his eyes.
The final fragment of the memory was waiting. The last file on the drive.

***

**12 Months Ago. The Server Farm.**

It was raining. Of course it was raining.
The industrial district was a graveyard of steel and concrete. Victor stood under the awning of a defunct textile factory.

Headlights cut through the downpour.
A sedan pulled up.
Sarah got out. She looked older than he remembered. Tired.

"You came," she said.

Victor reached into his pocket. He pulled out the USB drive.
"It's all there," he said. His voice was flat. "The emails. The invoices. The video."

Sarah took it. She held it like it was radioactive.
"This destroys them, Victor. The Board. The investors. All of it."
She looked at him. "You know what they'll do to you?"

"I'm already dead," Victor said. "I'm just waiting for the paperwork to catch up."

She nodded. She didn't offer false hope. She got back in the car.
"I'll have this online in an hour," she promised. "Goodbye, Victor."

The sedan drove away.
Victor watched the taillights fade.
He felt lighter. The weight was gone. The calculation was balanced.

He turned to walk back to his car.
A black SUV idled at the corner.
It moved slowly, purring like a large cat.
It stopped next to him.
The window rolled down.

Victor expected words. A threat. A bribe.
He got silence.

The man in the passenger seat raised a weapon. Silenced. Professional.
Victor saw the flash.

He didn't feel pain. Just an impact, like being shoved by a bully.
He fell backward into a puddle. The water was cold.
He looked up at the sky.
Rain.
Grey clouds.
Efficiency.

The SUV didn't speed away. It drove off at the speed limit.
Victor tried to breathe, but his lungs were full of something warm.
*Ah,* he thought. *Punctured lung. Three minutes to hypoxia.*

He closed his eyes.
*Worth it.*

**Darkness.**

Then, a voice. Not a human voice. A frequency.
**> SOUL DETECTED.**
**> DESIGNATION: OPTIMAL RESTRUCTURER.**
**> ANOMALY DETECTED: ALTRUISTIC SELF-TERMINATION.**
**> CALCULATING...**
**> DEPLOYING TO PRIORITY SECTOR: TERRA-INSOLVIA.**
**> OBJECTIVE: FIX THE SYSTEM.**

Victor opened his eyes.
The dungeon was silent.
The memory settled into place like the final brick in a wall.

He knew who he was.
He wasn't just a corporate shark who died of stress.
He was a man who had looked at the machine, seen it was eating children, and thrown his body into the gears.

He stood up.
On the screen, the Silver Lance was stepping onto the stairs.

"Sniv," Victor said.

"Yes, Boss?"

"My suit," Victor said, adjusting his tie. "Is it straight?"

"Boss looks... sharp," Sniv said, nodding.

"Good."

Victor walked out of the throne room.
He didn't head for the shadows. He headed for the light.

The Silver Lance reached the landing of the Fourth Floor.
Gareth had his sword drawn. "Boss room ahead. Tight formation."

"Wait," Alara said. "I detect... movement."

From the darkness of the archway, a figure emerged.
Small. Green.
Wearing a torn, dirty, but impeccably tailored Italian suit.

Victor Kaine stepped into the torchlight.
He didn't draw a weapon. He clasped his hands behind his back.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Victor said, his voice echoing smoothly off the stone walls. "I believe there has been a scheduling error."

The party froze.
Gareth blinked. "A... goblin?"

"I prefer 'Management'," Victor corrected. "And I'm afraid the Minotaur is currently in a meeting. Do you have an appointment?"
