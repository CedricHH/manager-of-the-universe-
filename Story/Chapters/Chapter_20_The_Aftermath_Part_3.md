# Chapter 20: The Aftermath (Part 3)

The mud pit on Floor 3 was performing above expectations.

Step one: Finn the Rogue spotted the tripwire.
Step two: Finn disarmed the tripwire with a smug grin.
Step three: The tripwire was a decoy. The real trigger was the pressure plate he stepped on to reach it.
Step four: *Splat*.

Victor watched through the scrying link as the Halfling vanished into waist-deep, viscous clay.

"Movement impaired," Victor noted, narrating for Sniv's benefit. "Stamina drain initiated. Dignity reduced by forty percent."

On the screen, the rest of the party scrambled.
Bron, the new Berserker, laughed. He was a massive man, shirtless despite the dungeon dampness, wielding a hammer that looked like an engine block on a stick.
"Little man play in mud!" Bron roared, reaching in to haul Finn out by his collar.

"Careful," hissed the woman in white robes. **Sister Alara**. A Paladin of the Sun. Level 15. The highest threat on the board.
She scanned the corridor, her eyes glowing with a detection skill.
"No spikes," she murmured. "No poison. Just... mud?"

"Maybe the Dungeon Core is broken," suggested Gareth, the Tank. "Or stupid."

"Or it's toying with us," said Kaelie, the Mage. She ignited a fireball in her palm, illuminating the gloom. "I don't like it. Traps usually try to kill you. These are just trying to... annoy us."

Victor leaned back on his throne, watching the chaos unfold through the scrying crystal. Every stumble, every curse, every wasted healing spell was a small victory.
"Annoyance causes mistakes," he whispered to himself, the old mantra. "Mistakes cause opportunities."

But would it be enough?

They moved forward with grim determination. The swinging log caught Bron square in the chest. It didn't break ribs—his Constitution was too high—but it knocked the wind out of him and sent him stumbling into the wall.

"Hah!" Bron laughed, straightening up. "Good swing! I like this dungeon!"

Victor made a mental note: *Berserkers enjoy non-lethal impacts. Recalibrate.*

The sleep darts were next. A sequence of pneumatic *thwips* from hidden tubes in the walls. Gareth's plate armor deflected most of them, the darts pinging off like rain on a tin roof. But one nicked Kaelie's arm, slipping past her arcane shield.

She swayed, her staff dipping. "Sleepy... feel..."

"Healer!" Gareth barked.

Alara was already moving. Golden light flared from her staff as she cast [Cleanse]. The drowsiness evaporated from Kaelie's eyes like morning mist.

"That's three spell slots," Victor counted. "One for the mud, two for the poison. She started with maybe fifteen. We're at twenty percent depletion and they haven't even reached the stairs."

"Is good, Boss?" Sniv asked hopefully.

"It's... acceptable," Victor admitted. "But they're efficient. They're not panicking. They're treating this like a job."

Because it *was* a job. To them, this dungeon was just another contract. Clear the floors, kill the boss, collect the bounty. They had probably done this a hundred times before. They would do it a hundred times after.

Unless Victor made this one memorable.

The party pushed past the third trap cluster without incident—Finn had disarmed the tripwire with practiced ease, and Lysa's [Detect Magic] flagged the pressure plates before anyone stepped on them.

Then they reached the stairs to the Fourth Floor.
The boundary line.
Beyond those stairs lay the Boss Room. Asterion.

Victor hesitated, his clawed fingers gripping the armrests of his stone throne so hard the granite creaked.

The Silver Lance was strong. Stronger than he had estimated. With the new recruits—especially Alara, whose level 15 meant she could probably solo most of the dungeon—they might actually stand a chance against the Minotaur.

If they killed Asterion, the dungeon would be "cleared." Victor would lose his General. His deterrent. His only real asset worth anything.

If Asterion killed them... well, Victor fulfilled his contract. "Worthy opponents" delivered. The Minotaur gets his fight. Everyone happy.

Except they weren't worthy. Not really. A Level 15 Paladin was good, but Asterion was Level 25 and had three centuries of combat experience. It wouldn't be a fight. It would be a slaughter.

And Asterion had specifically asked for a *fight*. Not a slaughter.

Victor closed his eyes, the weight of the decision pressing down on him.
The final fragment of the memory was waiting. The last file on the drive. The one he had been avoiding for months.


***

**12 Months Ago. The Server Farm.**

It was raining. Of course it was raining.
The industrial district was a graveyard of steel and concrete—abandoned factories, rusting cranes, the skeletons of an economy that had moved on. Victor stood under the awning of a defunct textile factory, the same one where he had closed his first major deal twenty years ago. Back then, it had been thriving. Now it was just another corpse.

He appreciated the symmetry.

Headlights cut through the downpour, twin beams slicing through the sheets of water.
A sedan pulled up, its engine purring. The driver killed the lights but left the motor running.
Sarah got out, pulling a coat over her head. She looked older than he remembered. The lines around her eyes were deeper. She had the look of someone who had stopped expecting happy endings.

"You came," she said, her voice barely audible over the rain.

Victor reached into his pocket. He pulled out the USB drive—the weight he had been carrying for months. It felt lighter now. Like it knew its purpose was almost fulfilled.

"It's all there," he said. His voice was flat, dead. The voice of a man who had already made his peace. "The emails. The invoices. The video. Everything the Board tried to bury."

Sarah took it. She held it like it was radioactive—which, in a sense, it was. This little piece of plastic would destroy careers, shatter fortunes, and probably put three men in prison for the rest of their lives.

"This destroys them, Victor," she said, her eyes meeting his. "The Board. The investors. All of it. The families will get justice."

"Good."

She hesitated. "You know what they'll do to you? You know you can't hide from this?"

"I'm already dead," Victor said simply. "I'm just waiting for the paperwork to catch up."

She nodded. She didn't offer false hope. She didn't say "we'll protect you" or "it'll be okay." She was a journalist. She knew what happened to whistleblowers in corporate America.

She got back in the car. The window rolled down.
"I'll have this online in an hour," she promised. "The world will know. Goodbye, Victor. And... thank you."

The sedan drove away, its taillights fading into the rain like dying stars.
Victor watched until the light was gone. He felt lighter. The weight was gone. The calculation was finally balanced. Assets and liabilities zeroed out.

He turned to walk back to his car.
A black SUV idled at the corner, its engine a low purr in the darkness.
Victor hadn't seen it arrive. Professional.
It moved slowly, creeping forward like a large cat stalking prey.
It stopped next to him.
The window rolled down.

Victor expected words. A threat. A bribe. The usual corporate offers: "Think about your family. Think about your future. We can make this go away."

He got silence.

The man in the passenger seat didn't speak. He simply raised a weapon. Silenced. Professional. It was almost boring in its efficiency.

Victor saw the flash.

He didn't feel pain. Not really. Just an impact, like being shoved by a bully on a playground.
He fell backward into a puddle. The water was cold. Shockingly cold. It soaked through his suit—the same three-thousand-dollar suit he had worn to the last board meeting.

He looked up at the sky.
Rain falling on his face.
Grey clouds.
The efficiency of it all.

The SUV didn't speed away. It drove off at the speed limit, following traffic laws. Why wouldn't they? They had nothing to fear. Dead men didn't file police reports.

Victor tried to breathe, but his lungs were full of something warm and wet.
*Ah,* he thought, the analytical part of his brain still running diagnostics. *Punctured lung. Three minutes to hypoxia. Blood loss approximately 40ml per second. Probability of survival without immediate intervention: 0.03%.*

He closed his eyes.
The pain was starting now. A distant thing, muffled by shock.
But behind the pain, there was something else.
Peace.

*Worth it.*

**Darkness.**

Then, a voice. Not a human voice. A frequency. Something that bypassed his ears entirely and spoke directly to the void where his soul should be.

> **SOUL DETECTED.**
> **DESIGNATION: OPTIMAL RESTRUCTURER.**
> **COMPETENCY PROFILE: EFFICIENCY (98TH PERCENTILE), RUTHLESSNESS (94TH PERCENTILE), LOGISTICS (99TH PERCENTILE).**
> **ANOMALY DETECTED: ALTRUISTIC SELF-TERMINATION.**
> **NOTE: Subject prioritized abstract "justice" over personal survival. Flagged for observation.**
> **CALCULATING...**
> **DEPLOYING TO PRIORITY SECTOR: TERRA-INSOLVIA.**
> **OBJECTIVE: FIX THE SYSTEM.**


***

Victor opened his eyes.
The dungeon was silent.
The memory settled into place like the final brick in a wall.

He knew who he was.
He wasn't just a corporate shark who died of stress.
He was a man who had looked at the machine, seen it was eating children, and thrown his body into the gears.

He stood up.
On the screen, the Silver Lance was stepping onto the stairs.

"Sniv," Victor said.

"Yes, Boss?"

"My suit," Victor said, adjusting his tie. "Is it straight?"

"Boss looks... sharp," Sniv said, nodding.

"Good."

Victor walked out of the throne room.
He didn't head for the shadows. He headed for the light.

The Silver Lance reached the landing of the Fourth Floor.
Gareth had his sword drawn. "Boss room ahead. Tight formation."

"Wait," Alara said. "I detect... movement."

From the darkness of the archway, a figure emerged.
Small. Green.
Wearing a torn, dirty, but impeccably tailored Italian suit.

Victor Kaine stepped into the torchlight.
He didn't draw a weapon. He clasped his hands behind his back.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Victor said, his voice echoing smoothly off the stone walls. "I believe there has been a scheduling error."

The party froze.
Gareth blinked. "A... goblin?"

"I prefer 'Management'," Victor corrected. "And I'm afraid the Minotaur is currently in a meeting. Do you have an appointment?"
