# Chapter 101: The Expansion Plan

Six hours after achieving the million.

Victor sat in the Core Chamber, staring at the notification that refused to disappear.

> **[ARMI - CONSORTIUM UPDATE]**
> Status: Independent Contractor (Verified)
> Achievement: 1.022M GP in 23 days
> New Tier: **REGIONAL OPERATOR**
> 
> **Next Milestone**: 10,000,000 GP
> Timeline: No deadline (performance-based advancement)
> Benefits Unlocked: [Institutional Analysis], [Market Penetration Protocol]
> 
> **Advisory**: Your success rate places you in top 8% of Restructurers.
> **Recommendation**: Scale operations to match capital base.

Ten million.

The number sat in his mind like a debt he'd already incurred.

One million had required insurance fraud, miracle arbitrage, and nearly getting arrested by Imperial Customs. Ten million would require... what? Selling the planet?

Victor dismissed the notification. ARMI didn't do sarcasm, but the phrasing felt pointed. *Scale operations to match capital base.* Translation: "Stop playing in the dungeon. You have institutional capital now. Act like it."

He pulled up the dungeon's revenue projections.

> **Dungeon Insolvia - Weekly Revenue Analysis**
> Ember Trials: 1,500 GP/week
> Entry Fees (Floors 1-4): 800 GP/week
> Premium Packages: 600 GP/week
> Loot Commissions: 400 GP/week
> **Total**: 3,300 GP/week

Sustainable. Profitable. Utterly insufficient.

At this rate, reaching ten million would take sixty-three weeks. The Consortium didn't set deadlines anymore because they didn't need to. Victor's psychology would do the work for them. He'd seen his ranking: top 8%. That meant 92% of Restructurers were beneath him. It also meant 8% were *above* him.

He couldn't tolerate that.

The door opened. Sniv entered, clipboard clutched to his chest, spectacles perched crookedly on his nose.

"Boss! Boss! Sniv has market intelligence! Very important intelligence!"

Victor gestured to the chair across from him. Sniv sat, though his feet didn't reach the floor.

"Report."

Sniv consulted his clipboard. He still couldn't read most of it, but he'd memorized the important parts.

"Merchant Guild raised potion prices. Thirty percent increase. Effective yesterday."

Victor's expression didn't change. "Public response?"

"Merchants complaining. Adventurers complaining. Poor people... stopped buying." Sniv's ears flattened. "Sniv remembers when goblins couldn't afford food. Humans now have same problem, but with healing juice."

"Potions," Victor corrected absently. His mind was already calculating. "What's the stated justification for the increase?"

"Guild Master Lysander says..." Sniv squinted at his notes. "...'market forces demand price corrections to ensure quality standards.'"

Translation: *We have a monopoly, and there's nothing you can do about it.*

Victor almost smiled.

"Anything else?"

Sniv hesitated. "Lysander also said... he said dungeon merchants are 'amateurs playing at business.' He said..." The goblin's voice dropped to a whisper, as if repeating blasphemy. "...'the Chainsaw should stick to killing monsters.'"

Silence.

Victor stood and walked to the chamber's edge, where the mana-thread map of Oakhaven hung suspended in the air. The Market Quarter glowed with transaction flows. The Merchant Guild's tower sat at the center like a tumor.

"Sniv."

"Yes, Boss!"

"Schedule a meeting with Asterion and Nova. Strategy session. One hour."

"What should Sniv tell them the meeting is about?"

Victor touched the glowing market district. The mana threads pulsed under his fingers.

"Tell them we're going into the potion business."

Sniv's eyes went wide. "Boss wants to fight the Merchant Guild?"

"No, Sniv." Victor turned from the map. "I'm going to bankrupt them. Then I'm going to buy them. There's a difference."

The goblin's confusion lasted exactly three seconds before transforming into worshipful excitement.

"Sniv will prepare the conference room! And the synergy charts! And the paradigm shift documents!"

He scurried out, still clutching his clipboard.

Victor returned to the map. Lysander's tower pulsed with concentrated economic power. Forty years of monopoly, protected by guild law and enforced by bought politicians.

Normally, that would be an impenetrable position.

But Victor had just spent twenty-three days learning how to break impenetrable positions.

He pulled up the dungeon's resource ledgers, specifically Floor 2 inventory.

> **Floor 2 (Fungal Caverns) - Weekly Output**
> Slime Cores (Disposed): 200 units
> Fungal Spores: 1,400 units
> Moss Samples: 600 units
> Trap Maintenance Cost: 50 GP

Disposed. Two hundred slime cores per week, thrown into the recycling mana flow because they had no use.

Except slime cores were the base ingredient for every potion the Merchant Guild produced.

Victor did the math.

Guild production cost per health potion: eight silver. Market price: fifty silver. Profit margin: 525%.

Slime-core production cost: three silver. Market price if he matched quality and undercut by 80%: ten silver. Profit margin: 233%.

More than enough.

The probability matrix assembled itself in his mind:

- Likelihood of Guild price war: 94%  
- Likelihood of sabotage attempts: 73%  
- Likelihood of City Council intervention: 45%  
- Likelihood of violent retaliation: 68%  
- Likelihood of Victor's victory if he stockpiled inventory first: 89%  

Acceptable risk.

He sent a mental pulse to Nova through the dungeon network. The Core's consciousness materialized as a shimmer of light.

"You're planning something expensive," Nova said. Not a question.

"Floor 2 modification. I need forty percent of the Fungal Caverns converted into slime breeding pools. Industrial scale. Output target: two thousand cores per week."

The light flickered—Nova's equivalent of a raised eyebrow.

"That's ten times current production. The ecosystem will collapse."

"Not if we automate the feeding systems. Fungal matter converts to slime biomass at a two-to-one ratio. We're already producing excess fungus. We're just optimizing resource allocation."

"You want to factory-farm slimes."

"I want to corner the potion market in Oakhaven."

Nova's light pulsed, thoughtful. "The Merchant Guild won't let you."

"The Merchant Guild won't have a choice. By the time they react, I'll have four thousand cores stockpiled and contracts with every major buyer in the city."

"And when they try to burn down your shop?"

"I'll have Asterion and forty-two professional soldiers guarding it."

The Core was silent for a long moment.

"What do I get out of this?"

Victor smiled. This was why he liked Nova. No moralizing. No questions about ethics. Just clean negotiation.

"Five percent of potion revenue."

"Seven."

"Three, plus I fund Floor 6 development next quarter."

"Three-point-five, and you fund Floor 6 *this* quarter."

"Agreed."

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Partnership Amendment - Dungeon Core]
> Terms: 3.5% potion revenue + Floor 6 development (Q1)
> Status: BINDING
> 
> Transaction: [Infrastructure Investment - Slime Breeding Facility]
> Cost: 15,000 GP
> Projected ROI: 340% (8-week window)
> Status: APPROVED
> 
> New Asset: **Automated Slime Farm Alpha**
> Output Capacity: 2,000 cores/week
> Maintenance Cost: 200 GP/week

The chamber's mana flow shifted as fifteen thousand gold drained from Victor's liquid reserves. Somewhere on Floor 2, construction began. Walls reforming. Pools excavating themselves. Feeding channels carving through stone.

Nova's light brightened. "You know what's funny?"

"What?"

"I spent three hundred years learning how to kill adventurers efficiently. You're teaching me capitalism. I'm not sure which is worse for humanity."

"Capitalism is more efficient."

"That's what worries me."

The Core's presence faded. Victor checked the time. Forty-three minutes until the strategy meeting.

He spent them drafting the acquisition plan.

When Asterion and Sniv entered the conference room, they found Victor surrounded by projected data screens.

The minotaur sat with his usual stoic calm. Sniv vibrated with excitement, clutching a notebook he'd labeled "POTION PARADIGM SHIFT."

"Gentlemen," Victor began. "Market analysis."

He gestured. The first screen expanded.

"Current Oakhaven potion market: one thousand gold per week in total sales. The Merchant Guild controls 100% market share. Their profit margin is 525%. They just raised prices by 30%, claiming quality standards."

Next screen.

"Our production capacity as of one hour ago: two thousand slime cores per week. Production cost per potion: three silver. If we price at ten silver—80% below Guild rates—our margin is 233%."

Asterion's eyes narrowed. "The Guild has killed competitors before."

"Which is why we're not competing. Phase one: silent production. Two weeks. We stockpile four thousand cores and hire alchemist defectors at triple Guild wages. Phase two: market launch. We open Insolvia Apothecary in the Market Quarter with prices the Guild can't match. Phase three: Guild response. They'll try price war, sabotage, and smear campaigns. We counter with stockpiled inventory and legal contracts with the City Guard—bulk discount, of course."

Sniv's hand shot up. "What is phase four?"

Victor's smile was thin.

"Phase four: acquisition. The Guild bankrupts itself trying to match our prices. We offer buyout terms. They work for us, or they lose everything."

Asterion leaned back. "You've done this before."

"The Bank of Oakhaven. The Gilded Ledger. The Mercenary Guild. This is the same playbook."

"And if Lysander refuses to sell?"

"Then he loses his tower, his assets, and his reputation. I'm offering him a severance package. Whether he takes it is his choice."

Sniv scribbled frantically. "Boss is doing... hostile takeover! Sniv knows this one!"

"Correct." Victor pulled up the final screen. "Assignments. Sniv, you're recruiting ten goblin shopkeepers. I need customer service training completed in two weeks. Asterion, you're security lead for the apothecary. Prevent sabotage. Rules of engagement: non-lethal unless they escalate to lethal force first."

"Understood."

"Budget allocation: thirty thousand gold for initial operations. Five thousand for store construction. Fifteen thousand for slime farm—already spent. Eight thousand for inventory. Two thousand for hired alchemists."

Victor stood. "Questions?"

Sniv raised his hand again. "When does Sniv tell applicants they're selling slime juice?"

"You don't. You tell them they're providing affordable healthcare to Oakhaven's underserved populations."

The goblin's face scrunched in concentration. Then enlightenment struck. "Ohhh. Slime juice is *affordable healthcare*. Not slime juice."

"Exactly."

Asterion remained still, but his tone carried weight. "The Guild will retaliate violently. You're certain you want this conflict?"

Victor met the minotaur's gaze.

"The Consortium gave me a ten-million-gold target. The dungeon generates 3,300 per week. At that rate, I'd need sixty-three weeks. I don't have sixty-three weeks."

"You don't have a deadline."

"I have a ranking. Top 8%. That means someone out there is faster than me." Victor's voice was flat. Factual. "I will not be outperformed by another Restructurer. If that requires bankrupting guild masters who call me an amateur, then that's not a conflict. It's just resource allocation."

Silence.

Then Asterion stood. "I'll begin security hiring immediately."

"Good."

Sniv clutched his notebook to his chest. "Sniv will make Boss proud! Customer service paradigm will be very synergistic!"

They left.

Victor sat alone in the conference room, surrounded by projections of Oakhaven's economic flows. The Merchant Guild's tower glowed at the center.

Forty years of monopoly.

Eight weeks until acquisition.

He was about to close the projections when ARMI pulsed a new notification.

> **[ARMI - MARKET ALERT]**
> Surveillance Protocol: ACTIVE
> 
> **Detected**: Unusual mana signature in Oakhaven Market Quarter  
> Source: Unknown  
> Pattern: Matches **Restructurer-class** energy  
> 
> **Analysis**:  
> Probability of second Consortium agent in region: 68%  
> Threat level: MODERATE  
> 
> **Recommendation**: Investigate before market entry.

Victor stared at the alert.

Another Restructurer. Here. In *his* city.

The Consortium hadn't mentioned territorial conflicts. Then again, they hadn't mentioned a lot of things.

He pulled up the mana signature map. The unknown energy pulsed from somewhere in the Market Quarter—irregular intervals, low intensity, but unmistakable. Same frequency as his own ARMI interface.

Probability matrix:

- Coincidental proximity: 12%  
- Intentional competition: 54%  
- Reconnaissance mission: 34%  

If another agent was targeting the same markets...

Victor closed the projection.

One problem at a time.

First, he'd bankrupt the Merchant Guild.

Then he'd deal with whoever was stupid enough to think they could operate in his territory without permission.

> **[ARMI]**
> New Quest: **[Market Intelligence]**
> Objective: Identify unknown Restructurer-class mana source
> Reward: Competitive advantage analysis
> Penalty: None (optional)
> Priority: MEDIUM

Victor dismissed the notification and stood.

Two weeks until launch.

Eight weeks until acquisition.

And somewhere in Oakhaven, another Restructurer was making plans of their own.

He almost looked forward to the introduction.

Competition, after all, was just another market inefficiency waiting to be corrected.

*In the Market Quarter, a hooded figure examined a potion vial under moonlight. The liquid inside glowed with an unnatural golden shimmer—brighter than any alchemist's work, more stable than any dungeon drop.*

*The figure smiled and tucked the vial away.*

*"Let's see how the Chainsaw handles real competition."*
