# Chapter 12: The Outside World

Sniv was terrified.

Victor could see it in the way the goblin's ears flattened against his skull, in the tremor of his hands as he clutched his oversized clipboard, in the way his yellow eyes kept darting toward the stairs leading up to Floor One.

"Sniv not ready," the goblin whispered. "Sniv is indoor goblin. Sniv manages resources. Sniv does not do... nature."

"You're a scout today," Victor said, adjusting the makeshift cloak he had fashioned from rat pelts. It smelled terrible, but it would help blend in with the shadows. "And you're not going to fight nature. You're going to observe it."

He smeared a mixture of mud and charcoal across Sniv's face, darkening his bright green skin.

"Remember the mission," Victor recited. "Go to the nearest road. Hide. Watch. Listen. Come back. Under no circumstances are you to engage with humans, elves, or anything that walks on two legs. Understood?"

"Understood," Sniv squeaked. "Hide. Watch. Run away."

"Strategic retreat," Victor corrected. "But yes. Run away."

He led the small goblin up the stairs.

Floor Two passed quickly—the organized rows of mushroom farms, the goblins nodding respectfully as their Boss walked by. Floor One was different. It was the original entrance, a ruined temple that had collapsed decades ago, leaving a jagged scar in the earth.

Sunlight—real, unfiltered sunlight—streamed through the cracks in the ceiling, cutting through the gloom like laser beams.

Sniv hissed and covered his eyes. "It burns! The sky-fire burns!"

"It's just the sun, Sniv. It provides Vitamin D. You'll adapt."

Victor stopped at the edge of the rubble. Beyond lay the exit—a gap in the stone wide enough for a man, or a goblin, to squeeze through.

"Go," Victor said softly. "You're making history. The first employee of the Kaine Dungeon Corporation to conduct field research."

Sniv looked at the exit. Then at Victor. He took a deep breath, straightened his small spine, and stepped into the light.

The world was too big.

That was Sniv's first thought as he crawled out of the hole in the earth. The ceiling was gone. The walls were gone. In their place remained a vast, terrified emptiness of blue and green.

The air moved. It pushed against his skin, carrying smells he didn't have names for. Pine needles. Wet earth. Something sweet and floral that made his nose twitch uncontrollably.

He froze, his instincts screaming at him to burrow back into the safety of the stone. His heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird, beating so fast it made his vision blur.

*Boss trusts Sniv. Boss says Sniv is smart.*

*But Boss is not here. Boss is safe in stone.*

Sniv pressed his face into the dirt, trying to ground himself. Dirt he understood. Soil. Roots. These were safe things. It was the... the *up* that was wrong. The endless blue void that threatened to suck him into the sky if he let go of the ground.

He forced himself to move. One step. Two. Keeping low, belly dragging against the forest floor, just like he used to do when hiding from the Alpha. Every snap of a twig sounded like a gunshot. Every rustle of leaves sounded like a predator.

He reached the treeline and paused. Through the gaps in the vegetation, he saw a flat, grey ribbon cutting through the green.

A road.

And on the road: noise.

*Clop-clop-clop.*

Sniv scrambled behind a boulder, his claws digging into the granite. He peeked over the top, his eyes narrowed to slits against the punishing brightness.

A cart. A wooden box on wheels, pulled by a massive beast that looked like a rat but huge and brown. Muscle rippled under its fur as it pulled the load without effort.

Two figures walked beside it.

Humans.

They were tall. Impossibly tall. Covered in metal that gleamed in the sun—polished steel breastplates, greaves, helmets with plumes of colored hair. Swords hung at their waists—real swords, not the rusted scrap goblins scavenged.

Sniv held his breath until his lungs burned.

"...swear I heard something," one guard said. His voice was deep, rough like grinding stones. He stopped, scanning the treeline. His hand drifted to his sword hilt.

"Probably a deer," the other replied. He adjusted his helmet, wiping sweat from his forehead. "Stop being jumpy, Kegan. We're five leagues from Oakhaven. The King's Road is safe."

"Not since the rumors started. People saying the Old Temple is active again."

Sniv's ears perked up. *Active.*

"Bullshit," the second guard scoffed. "That place has been empty since I was a boy. My grandfather talked about the Silver Dawn clearing it out fifty years ago. Since then? Just rats and ghosts."

"I don't know," the first guard insisted, his eyes still lingering on Sniv's hiding spot. "Miller said he saw lights. Green lights. And heard hammering. Since when do ghosts hammer stone?"

"Miller was drunk. Miller is always drunk. Come on. I want to get to the city before sundown. The ale at the Gilded Tankard isn't going to drink itself."

The cart rumbled past. The smell of the beast—sweat and hay—washed over Sniv, overpowering the floral scent.

Sniv watched until they disappeared around a bend in the road, memorizing every detail. The crest on their armor (a white tree). The weapons they carried. The dismissive way they talked about the dungeon.

*Oakhaven. Five leagues. Temple active. Humans curious but skeptical.*

He waited another ten minutes, just to be sure. A bird landed on the boulder next to him and chirped. Sniv flinched so hard he almost gave himself away.

*Nature is loud. Nature is bright. Nature is terrible.*

He turned and ran back to the safety of the dark.

"Oakhaven," Victor repeated, staring at the charcoal map Sniv had drawn on the floor of the Boss Chamber. "Five leagues. That's... what? Fifteen miles? A day's walk. Maybe less for a mounted party."

"Big town," Sniv reported, wiping mud from his face. He was shivering slightly, the adrenaline of the surface fading into exhaustion. "Guards had good metal. Shiny. Not rusted. Talked about 'King's Road' and 'Gilded Tankard.'"

"And they think the dungeon is active, but empty."

"Think it is ghosts," Sniv confirmed. "Say 'bullshit' to goblins. Say Miller was drunk."

Victor paced the chamber, his mind spinning schemes. This was good intelligence. High-quality data.

The market knew the product existed (the dungeon). But the market perceived the product as low-value (empty, haunted). There was no demand because there was no perceived supply of loot.

"We have a branding problem," Victor muttered. "Adventurers don't raid ruins for ghosts. Ghosts are annoying. They drain resources, require magical weapons to hit, and drop no loot."

He stopped pacing. "They raid for treasure. Experience. Glory. We need to signal that we have all three."

He looked at the pile of rusted equipment salvaged from the goblins. Worthless.

Then he looked at the one item of value they possessed: the glowing sword Marcus had wielded. The "Fire-Stick." Its blade still hummed with faint magical energy, casting a warm orange light against the stone.

"We need bait," Victor said. "We need to prove that this isn't just a hole in the ground. We need to show them that there's something worth dying for down here."

Sniv followed his gaze to the sword. "Boss give Fire-Stick to humans?"

"No. We show it to them. We put it somewhere they can see it. Somewhere they can *almost* reach."

The Teaser Strategy. Classic marketing. Show the premium product, create desire, then put a paywall (or a dungeon full of traps) in front of it.

"We place it on Floor One," Victor mused. "In the entry hall. Protected by a basic trap—something scary but not lethal. We want the first scout to see it, try to grab it, fail, and run back to town telling stories about a magical sword guarded by monsters."

"Trap?" Sniv asked. "Sniv makes falling rocks?"

"Better. We use the environment." Victor pointed to the map. "But first, we have to endure the deadline."

The imp returned at sunset on the second day.

It materialized on the arm of the throne, its ember-eyes glowing with malicious amusement.

**"The Master grows impatient. The deadline approaches."**

Victor sat comfortably, legs crossed. He held an object wrapped in cloth.

"The Manager acknowledges the claim," Victor said formally. "We are prepared to discuss terms for a... long-term partnership."

The imp hissed. **"Partnership? The Master does not have partners. He has subjects."**

"Every landlord has tenants," Victor corrected. "And good tenants are hard to find. We keep the place clean. We keep the pests out. We bring value to the property."

He unwrapped the cloth.

Inside was Sir Kael's sword.

It was rusted, useless as a weapon. But the hilt still bore the silver crest of the Dawn, and the blade—though pitted—was unmistakable as the work of a master smith.

"A down payment," Victor said. "A sample of the tribute to come. Proof that we understand the history of this place."

The imp stared at the sword. It recognized the crest.

**"The Silver Dawn,"** the ancient voice rumbled. **"A persistent annoyance, fifty years ago."**

"And they'll be back," Victor said. "More of them. Stronger ones. And when they come, wouldn't it be better if we were working together to... greet them?"

The imp picked up the sword. It was heavy for the small creature, but it lifted the blade with surprising strength.

**"The Master will accept this... gesture. As a down payment."** The imp's eyes narrowed. **"But the full tribute schedule must be established within seven days. Or the dealership is closed."**

"seven days," Victor agreed. "We'll have a proposal ready."

The imp vanished.

Victor let out a long breath. He had bought a week.

Seven days to turn a ruined temple into a tourist attraction for suicidal adventurers. Seven days to set the trap. Seven days to convince a Level 25 Minotaur that eating humans was better than eating goblins.

He looked at Sniv.

"Get the Board," Victor said. "We're pivoting to marketing."
