# Chapter 19: The Aftermath (Part 2)

Victor stood on the edge of the pit on Floor 3.

It had been a spike pit. Sharp, rusted iron stakes pointing upward like hungry teeth. Lethal. Efficient. The kind of trap that ended an adventurous career in 0.5 seconds with a sickening *thunk*.

Now, it was brown.

"More water," Victor ordered.

Sniv, standing on the other side with a bucket, looked miserable. "Boss... mud is sloppy. Mud stain clothes. Spikes better. Spikes make holes."

"We aren't making holes, Sniv," Victor said, checking the consistency of the sludge. It was thick, viscous clay. Perfect for immobilizing heavy armor. "We're making delays."

He tapped the wall. "And the poison darts?"

"Swapped," Sniv sighed, shoulders drooping. "Sleepy-juice. From Drowsee-Flowers."

"Good."

Victor walked along the corridor. The swinging blade trap—a massive pendulum of sharpened steel—had been dismantled. In its place hung a log deeply wrapped in moss and leather. It wouldn't slice a man in half. It would just break a rib and knock the wind out of him.

"Why, Boss?" Sniv asked, trotting to keep up. "Adventurers come to kill us. Why we not kill them?"

Victor stopped. He looked at the goblin. It was a valid question. From a creature whose entire existence was "Kill or be killed", Victor's strategy looked like madness.

"Because dead adventurers are a sunk cost," Victor said, reverting to the only language that made sense to him. "You kill them, you loot them once. End of transaction. But if you *beat* them... if you humiliate them... they come back. They bring friends. They bring higher-level gear."

"We farming?" Sniv asked, eyes widening.

"We're farming," Victor confirmed. "But we're farming their ego."

It was a lie. Partially.
The strategy was sound—Victor could justify it on a whiteboard. But the *reason*... the reason was something else.

The reason was in the memory that wouldn't let him go.

***

**12 Months Ago. Earth.**

The apartment was dark. The power had been cut yesterday. Victor sat by the window, illuminated only by the city lights below.

He had watched the video a hundred times.
He knew the sound of the collapse by heart. The scream of the supervisor.

He had the evidence. The USB drive felt heavy in his pocket, like a stone that could drag him to the bottom of the ocean.

He could delete it.
If he destroyed the drive, the evidence vanished. The Board would win. The children would be forgotten. But Victor... Victor might survive. He could disappear. Move to a non-extradition country. Start over.

He ran the probability simulation:
**Scenario A: Silence.**
- Survival Chance: 95%
- Financial Recovery: 40%
- Moral Debt: Infinite.

**Scenario B: Disclosure.**
- Survival Chance: < 5%
- Financial Recovery: 0%
- Justice: 100%

He wasn't a hero. Heroes were irrational variables who messed up projections. He was a manager. He optimized systems.

And this system... this system was broken.
It was producing misery at an unacceptable rate.

His phone buzzed. It was the last bit of battery he had.
Unknown number.

He answered.
"Kaine."

"I know what you have," a voice said. Female. Hard. "Sarah told me."

Sarah. The colleague he had argued with about layoffs years ago. She had quit. Become an investigative journalist. She was the one leak he hadn't plugged.

"I don't have anything," Victor lied.

"Don't give me that corporate bullshit, Victor," the voice snapped. "I saw the internal memos. I know you requested the server logs before they locked you out. You have the Cobalt files."

Victor didn't speak.

"If you have them," she said, her voice softening, "you can end this. You can burn them down, Victor. All of them."

"And if I do?" Victor asked. "What happens to me?"

"You know what happens. They won't let you walk away."

Silence.

"Meet me," she said. "The old server farm in the industrial district. 24 hours. Rain or shine."

"Why there?"

"Because it has no cameras. And because it's where you started, isn't it? Your first big restructuring job?"

It was. The irony was efficient.

"I'll think about it," Victor said.

"Don't think, Victor," she said before hanging up. "For once in your miserable life, just feel."

Victor looked at the phone as it died. Black screen.

He stood up. He walked to the window.
He looked at the city.
He had spent twenty years building towers of money. He had thought that was the score.
But looking at the reflection in the glass—hollow, bearded, broken—he realized he had been playing the wrong game.

He went to the closet. He put on his last clean suit.
He didn't sleep. He sat in the dark, and for the first time, he didn't calculate.
He just waited for the dawn.

"Boss? Boss!"

Victor snapped back.
He was gripping the handle of the lever so hard his knuckles (green, clawed) were white.

"Boss gone again," Sniv whispered to a nearby goblin. "Boss seeing ghosts."

Victor released the lever. He took a breath. The dungeon air was cool.

"I'm here, Sniv," Victor said. "Just... checking the mechanism."

"Mechanism good!" Sniv beamed. "Logs swing *whoosh*! Poisons go *psst*! Mud goes *splat*!"

"Excellent," Victor said dryly. "The symphony of non-lethal violence."

He walked toward the stairs. "Is the perimeter secure?"

"Yes, Boss. Rats are watching. Bats are watching. No adventurers."

As if on cue, a chiming sound echoed through Victor's skull.

> **[ARMI Alert]**
> **Perimeter Breach Detected.**
> **Sector:** Main Entrance.
> **Entities:** 6
> **Threat Level:** High (Level 10-15 Average)

Victor froze.
He pulled up the visual feed.
The entrance tunnel. The massive stone doors he had repaired.
They were being pushed open.

First came the tank. A man in shining plate armor, shield raised. **The Silver Lance.**
Then the mage. Robes, staff glowing blue.
Then a rogue. Leather armor, daggers drawn.
A ranger with a longbow.

But there were two more.
A woman in white robes with a sun symbol on her staff. **Healer.**
And a massive man with a two-handed hammer, shirtless, covered in tattoos. **Berserker.**

Six of them. A full raid party.
This wasn't a scouting run. This was an eviction notice.

> **[ARMI Analysis]**
> **Party Composition:** Balanced (Tank, Healer, DPS, CC).
> **Objective:** Clear and Conquer.
> **Projected Outcome (Direct Combat):** Total Defeat.

Victor looked at Sniv. The goblin was trembling. He could smell the adventurers—the scent of steel and soap.

"Sniv," Victor said, his voice dropping to a command frequency. "Plans A through C are scrapped. Initiate Plan D."

"Plan D?" Sniv squeaked. "We have Plan D?"

"Distraction," Victor said. "Delay. Disorient."

He smoothed his suit.
"They're expecting a fight. We're going to give them a circus."

The footsteps echoed down the corridor. Heavy. Confident.
The kind of confidence that came from knowing you were the hero of the story.

Victor stepped into the shadows.
"Let's see how they handle the mud."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Status:** Combat Mode Engaged.
> **Objective:** Survive.
