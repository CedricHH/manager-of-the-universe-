# Chapter 19: The Aftermath (Part 2)

Victor stood on the edge of the pit on Floor 3.

It had been a spike pit. Sharp, rusted iron stakes pointing upward like hungry teeth. Lethal. Efficient. The kind of trap that ended an adventurous career in 0.5 seconds with a sickening *thunk*.

Now, it was brown.

"More water," Victor ordered.

Sniv, standing on the other side with a bucket, looked miserable. "Boss... mud is sloppy. Mud stain clothes. Spikes better. Spikes make holes."

"We aren't making holes, Sniv," Victor said, checking the consistency of the sludge. It was thick, viscous clay. Perfect for immobilizing heavy armor. "We're making delays."

He tapped the wall. "And the poison darts?"

"Swapped," Sniv sighed, shoulders drooping. "Sleepy-juice. From Drowsee-Flowers."

"Good."

Victor walked along the corridor. The swinging blade trap—a massive pendulum of sharpened steel—had been dismantled. In its place hung a log heavily padded with moss and leather. It wouldn't slice a man in half. It would just break a rib and knock the wind out of him.

"Why, Boss?" Sniv asked, trotting to keep up. "Adventurers come to kill us. Why we not kill them?"

Victor stopped. He looked at the goblin. It was a valid question. From a creature whose entire existence was "Kill or be killed", Victor's strategy looked like madness.

"Because dead adventurers are a sunk cost," Victor said, reverting to the only language that made sense to him. "You kill them, you loot them once. End of transaction. But if you *beat* them... if you humiliate them... they come back. They bring friends. They bring higher-level gear."

"We farming?" Sniv asked, eyes widening.

"We're farming," Victor confirmed. "But we're farming their ego."

It was a lie. Partially.
The strategy was sound—Victor could justify it on a whiteboard. But the *reason*... the reason was something else.

The reason was in the memory that wouldn't let him go.

***

**12 Months Ago. Earth.**

The apartment was dark. The power had been cut yesterday—another piece of his life being dismantled by the men who had betrayed him. Victor sat by the window, illuminated only by the city lights below. The skyline looked like a circuit board from up here, all gridded streets and blinking towers. He used to own pieces of that grid. Now he was just a ghost watching from the shadows.

He had watched the video a hundred times.
He knew the sound of the collapse by heart. The crack of timber. The rush of falling earth. The single, cut-off scream of the supervisor.
And the silence afterward. The silence was the worst part. The silence of children who no longer made any sound at all.

He had the evidence. The USB drive felt heavy in his pocket, like a stone that could drag him to the bottom of the ocean. He had been carrying it for weeks now. It had become a physical part of him—the weight of 47 deaths condensed into 32 gigabytes of data.

He could delete it.
If he destroyed the drive, the evidence vanished. The Board would win. The children would be forgotten—just another line item in a supply chain audit, a footnote in a quarterly report that no one would ever read. But Victor... Victor might survive. He could disappear. Move to a non-extradition country. Indonesia, maybe. Or Thailand. Start over with a new name and a clean conscience.

*No,* he thought. *Not a clean conscience. Never that.*

He ran the probability simulation:
**Scenario A: Silence.**
- Survival Chance: 95%
- Financial Recovery: 40%
- Moral Debt: Infinite.

**Scenario B: Disclosure.**
- Survival Chance: < 5%
- Financial Recovery: 0%
- Justice: 100%

The math was clear. Silence was the profitable choice. Silence was what a manager would do. Silence was what Victor Kaine, "The Chainsaw," would do.

But the video kept playing in his head. The small hand reaching from the rubble.

He wasn't a hero. Heroes were irrational variables who messed up projections. He was a manager. He optimized systems.

And this system... this system was broken.
It was producing misery at an unacceptable rate. And for the first time in his life, Victor couldn't optimize his way out of the moral equation.


His phone buzzed. It was the last bit of battery he had.
Unknown number.

He answered.
"Kaine."

"I know what you have," a voice said. Female. Hard. "Sarah told me."

Sarah. The colleague he had argued with about layoffs years ago. She had quit. Become an investigative journalist. She was the one leak he hadn't plugged.

"I don't have anything," Victor lied.

"Don't give me that corporate bullshit, Victor," the voice snapped. "I saw the internal memos. I know you requested the server logs before they locked you out. You have the Cobalt files."

Victor didn't speak.

"If you have them," she said, her voice softening, "you can end this. You can burn them down, Victor. All of them."

"And if I do?" Victor asked. "What happens to me?"

"You know what happens. They won't let you walk away."

Silence.

"Meet me," she said. "The old server farm in the industrial district. 24 hours. Rain or shine."

"Why there?"

"Because it has no cameras. And because it's where you started, isn't it? Your first big restructuring job?"

It was. The irony was efficient.

"I'll think about it," Victor said.

"Don't think, Victor," she said before hanging up. "For once in your miserable life, just feel."

Victor looked at the phone as it died. Black screen.

He stood up. He walked to the window.
He looked at the city.
He had spent twenty years building towers of money. He had thought that was the score.
But looking at the reflection in the glass—hollow, bearded, broken—he realized he had been playing the wrong game.

He went to the closet. He put on his last clean suit.
He didn't sleep. He sat in the dark, and for the first time, he didn't calculate.
He just waited for the dawn.

"Boss? Boss!"

Victor snapped back.
Victor released the lever. He took a breath. His pulse spiked to 140 BPM, adrenaline flushing his system until he forced the biological response into a controlled baseline. The dungeon air was cool.

"I'm here, Sniv," Victor said. "Just... checking the mechanism."

"Mechanism good!" Sniv beamed. "Logs swing *whoosh*! Poisons go *psst*! Mud goes *splat*!"

"Excellent," Victor said dryly. "The symphony of non-lethal violence."

He walked toward the stairs. "Is the perimeter secure?"

"Yes, Boss. Rats are watching. Bats are watching. No adventurers."

A chiming sound echoed through Victor's skull.

> **[ARMI Alert]**
> **Perimeter Breach Detected.**
> **Sector:** Main Entrance.
> **Entities:** 6
> **Threat Level:** High (Level 10-15 Average)
> **Recommended Action:** Evacuation

Victor froze.
He pulled up the visual feed, the scrying crystal projecting a ghostly image into his peripheral vision.
The entrance tunnel. The massive stone doors he had spent three days repairing with goblin labor and stolen mortar.
They were being pushed open with contemptuous ease.

First came the tank. **Gareth**, leader of the Silver Lance—a man built like a siege engine, encased in shining plate armor that probably cost more than Victor's entire previous salary. His tower shield bore the emblem of a lance piercing a star. Professional. Confident. Dangerous.

Then the mage. **Kaelie.** Robes of deep blue, staff glowing with barely contained arcane energy. Her fingers twitched with the nervous energy of someone who could set the world on fire and was actively considering it.

Then a rogue. **Finn**, the Halfling, leather armor oiled to silence, twin daggers already drawn. He was the one who had spotted Victor's trip wires last time. The one Victor needed to fool twice.

A cleric hung back. **Lysa**, the Elf, her eyes closed, likely sensing the dungeon's magic signature. She would be the early warning system. The one who detected lies.

But there were two more.
A woman in white robes with a sun symbol blazing on her staff—**Sister Alara**, Paladin of the Sun. Level 15. Victor's ARMI interface highlighted her threat assessment in angry red. She had [Divine Sense]. She could detect evil. She could detect *him*.

And behind them all, a massive man with a two-handed hammer, shirtless despite the dungeon dampness, covered in tattoos that seemed to writhe in the torchlight. **Bron**, the Berserker. Level 14. He looked like he wrestled bears for breakfast and then ate the bears.

Six of them. A full raid party.
This wasn't a scouting run. This was an eviction notice. They had come to clear the dungeon, claim the loot, and move on to the next payday.

> **[ARMI Analysis]**
> **Party Composition:** Balanced (Tank, Healer, DPS, CC, Divine Detection).
> **Combined Level:** 75 (Average: 12.5)
> **Objective:** Clear and Conquer.
> **Projected Outcome (Direct Combat):** Total Defeat.
> **Projected Outcome (Guerrilla Harassment):** Uncertain.


Victor looked at Sniv. The goblin was trembling. He could smell the adventurers—the scent of steel and soap.

"Sniv," Victor said, his voice dropping to a command frequency. "Plans A through C are scrapped. Initiate Plan D."

"Plan D?" Sniv squeaked. "We have Plan D?"

"Distraction," Victor said. "Delay. Disorient."

He smoothed his suit.
"They're expecting a fight. We're going to give them a circus."

The footsteps echoed down the corridor. Heavy. Confident.
The kind of confidence that came from knowing you were the hero of the story.

Victor stepped into the shadows.
"Let's see how they handle the mud."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Status:** Combat Mode Engaged.
> **Objective:** Survive.
