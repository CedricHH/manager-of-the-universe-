# Chapter 70: The Stress Test

The Crimson Blades arrived at exactly 9:00 AM.

Five adventurers, all wearing their guild's signature red armor, stood at the dungeon entrance with expressions ranging from annoyed to openly hostile.

Their leader, **Theron Bloodstrike**, was a mountain of a man—six-foot-four, scarred face, greatsword strapped to his back. Victor recognized him immediately.

The same warrior who'd vandalized Floor 3 during Inspector Vorne's "stress test."

"Kaine," Theron said flatly.

"Bloodstrike," Victor replied. "Thank you for coming."

"We didn't have a choice. Guild Master's orders. Apparently, we owe you a 'favor.'" His tone made it clear what he thought of that.

Victor smiled. "Then let's make this quick. You're here to stress-test Floor 5. Volcanic biome. Dragon boss. End-game difficulty."

Theron's eye twitched. "You want us to fight a *dragon*?"

"I want you to *survive* a dragon," Victor corrected. "There's a difference."

The rest of the party exchanged glances:

- **Mira** (healer, nervous energy, clutching her staff)
- **Kael** (rogue, twin daggers, cocky smirk)
- **Elena** (mage, already analyzing the dungeon with detection spells)
- **Garrick** (archer, silent, methodical)

All level 17-19. Experienced. Professional.

But clearly skeptical.

"If we die in there," Theron said slowly, "the Guild will shut you down."

"Then don't die," Victor said. "Follow me."

***

**The Descent**

The moment they stepped through the obsidian gateway, the temperature spiked.

"Gods," Mira gasped. "It's like walking into an oven."

Elena immediately cast cooling enchantments on the party—a shimmering blue aura that made the heat *slightly* more bearable.

"How long does that last?" Victor asked.

"Twenty minutes," Elena said. "Then we're on fire resistance potions."

"How many do you have?"

"Six. Between all of us."

Victor took mental notes.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Stress Test Metrics - Entry Phase**:
>
> - Cooling enchantment duration: 20 minutes
> - Fire resistance potions: 6 (limited resource)
> - Party composition: Balanced (tank, healer, DPS x3)
> - Initial morale: MODERATE

They moved deeper.

The volcanic biome was even more spectacular—and dangerous—than Victor had designed.

Obsidian bridges spanned rivers of molten lava. Sulfur vents hissed poisonous gas. Fire crystals jutted from walls, glowing like captured stars.

Kael tested an obsidian bridge. It held.

Then he leaned over the edge, looking down at the lava.

"Don't," Garrick warned.

Kael ignored him, tossing a dagger into the molten river.

It melted instantly.

"Good to know," Kael muttered.

They navigated carefully:

- **Bridge crossing**: Theron led, testing weight distribution
- **Sulfur vents**: Elena detected poison, party detoured
- **Fire crystals**: Mira wanted to harvest—Victor's projection appeared: "After the fight"
- **Heat zones**: Garrick monitored party HP—everyone losing 5 HP/minute

By the time they reached the central arena, eighteen minutes had passed.

Elena's cooling enchantments were failing.

"Potions," Mira ordered.

Everyone drank. The blue sheen returned.

Victor, watching via scrying orb from his office, updated his analysis:

> **[ARMI]**
> **Environmental Performance**:
>
> - Time to boss: 18 minutes (TARGET: 15-20) ✅
> - Resource depletion: 40% potions consumed ✅
> - HP damage (environmental): 15% average ✅
> - Hazard effectiveness: HIGH ✅
> - **Assessment**: Floor difficulty calibrated correctly

Theron wiped sweat from his face. "This is insane. We haven't even reached the boss yet."

Victor's projection appeared beside him. "That's intentional. End-game content filters casual players."

"We're not casual," Theron growled.

"Then prove it."

***

**The Dragon Fight**

They entered Ignatia's arena.

She was waiting.

Perched on a lava throne, wings spread dramatically, surrounded by glittering "treasure" (mostly polished glass, but the Crimson Blades didn't know that). Her red scales gleamed in the firelight, and her golden eyes tracked their every movement.

The arena itself was circular—sixty feet in diameter, obsidian floor, lava moat surrounding the platform.

And blocking the entrance: a pressure plate.

"**BOW**," a magical voice commanded.

Theron stopped. "What?"

"**BOW BEFORE IGNATIA, THE EMBER TYRANT, OR THE PATH REMAINS CLOSED**."

Theron's jaw clenched. His hand went to his sword.

"Don't," Mira whispered. "Just... do it."

"I don't bow to—"

"**BOW**."

Theron, furious, bent at the waist. Stiffly. Barely.

The pressure plate clicked.

The obsidian door opened.

Ignatia's voice echoed across the arena—deep, theatrical, perfectly rehearsed:

"Welcome, mortals, to your trial by fire. I am Ignatia, the Ember Tyrant, guardian of this domain. You may *attempt* to claim my hoard. But know this: few have faced me and lived. Fewer still have *won*."

She clearly loved this.

Kael muttered, "Is she... enjoying herself?"

"Yes," Victor's projection confirmed.

"Fight begins in three... two... one..."

Ignatia *roared*.

***

**Phase 1: Testing** (3 minutes)

Ignatia opened with fire breath—a cone of flame thirty feet long.

Theron raised his shield. The flames washed over him. His HP dropped by 40 points.

"HEALER!" he shouted.

Mira cast restoration. Theron's health jumped back up.

The dragon landed, swiping with claws.

Theron blocked, grunting under the impact. "She hits like a siege engine!"

Kael circled behind, attempting a backstab.

His daggers scraped uselessly off her scales.

"Scales too thick!" he yelled.

Elena launched a fireball.

It hit Ignatia square in the chest.

She didn't even flinch.

"Fire resistance!" Elena cursed. "Switching elements!"

Garrick fired three arrows in rapid succession—targeting Ignatia's eyes.

One grazed her left eye.

She roared, furious now.

***

**Phase 2: Escalation** (4 minutes)

Ignatia took flight, wings beating hurricane-force wind.

The party scattered.

From above, she rained fire—targeted bursts that forced constant repositioning.

Garrick rolled left. Fire scorched the ground where he'd been standing.

Theron tried to maintain aggro. "DOWN HERE, LIZARD!"

Ignatia ignored him, focusing on the squishier targets.

She dive-bombed Mira.

The healer barely dodged—

—but Ignatia's wing clipped her anyway.

40 damage. Mira flew ten feet, slammed into obsidian.

"MIRA!" Theron charged.

Elena switched to ice magic—crystalline spears materialized, launching at the dragon.

One hit Ignatia's left wing.

Ice spread across the membrane.

Ignatia screeched, wobbling in flight.

"THERE!" Kael pointed. "The wing membrane! It's vulnerable!"

"Focus fire!" Theron ordered.

***

**Phase 3: Climax** (3 minutes)

The party coordinated.

Elena froze the left wing completely.

Garrick fired explosive arrows—puncturing the fragile membrane.

Kael, using a grappling hook, swung onto Ignatia's back and slashed the wing joint.

Ignatia crashed to the ground, roaring in rage.

She planted herself, drawing in a massive breath.

Her chest glowed white-hot.

"ULTIMATE!" Elena screamed. "SCATTER!"

**INFERNO BURST**.

A nova of flame erupted from Ignatia—fifty feet in all directions.

Mira threw up a holy shield.

The flames hammered against it.

The shield cracked.

Held.

Barely.

When the fire cleared, everyone was at 30% HP.

But alive.

"NOW!" Theron roared.

Everyone burned their cooldowns:

- Theron: **Titan's Strike** (massive overhead smash)
- Elena: **Glacial Tomb** (froze Ignatia's legs)
- Kael: **Shadow Step** + dual critical strikes
- Garrick: **Volley** (twelve arrows, simultaneous impact)
- Mira: **Divine Wrath** (holy damage beam)

Ignatia's HP bar—visible via magical HUD—dropped to zero.

She collapsed.

Dramatically.

Wings splayed. Eyes closed. Smoke rising from scales.

Then... she opened one eye.

"Well fought, mortals."

Her body dissolved into mana, respawning at 30% HP per the magical contract.

A treasure chest materialized in the center of the arena.

***

**The Debrief**

Back in Victor's office, the Crimson Blades collapsed into chairs.

They were exhausted. Burned. Bruised.

But smiling.

Theron drank water like he'd crossed a desert. "That was... I'll admit it. That was incredible."

Victor leaned forward. "Feedback?"

Theron considered.

"Environmental hazards: Ten out of ten. Brutal but fair. We had tools to handle them."

"Boss difficulty?"

"Nine out of ten. Perfectly tuned for our level. Any harder and it'd be impossible. Any easier and it'd be boring."

"Loot quality?"

Elena held up enchanted gauntlets. "Fire resistance +40%. Market value: 300 GP. Plus the fire ruby and gold. Eight out of ten. Could be slightly better for the effort."

Victor noted everything.

"Spectacle?" he asked.

Theron grinned. "Best dragon fight I've ever experienced. The bow mechanic? Genius. The monologue? Chef's kiss. Ignatia's a *personality*. That's worth the entry fee alone."

"Speaking of which," Garrick said quietly. "We used 600 GP in consumables. Potions, scrolls, repair kits. Entry fee is 100 GP. Loot was 300 GP. We're net negative 400 GP."

Victor pulled up his calculations:

> **[ARMI]**
> **Floor 5 Economics Analysis**:
>
> - Entry Fee: 100 GP/party
> - Average Loot Value: 300 GP
> - Consumables Required: ~600 GP
> - **Net Cost to Adventurers**: -400 GP per run
> - **Victor's Revenue**: 100 GP (entry) + 24 GP (8% Merchant's Guild transport fee on 300 GP loot)
> - **Profit Per Run**: 124 GP
> - **Break-Even Point**: 65 successful runs
> - **Timeline at 5 runs/week**: ~13 weeks

"Will people pay that?" Garrick asked.

Theron answered before Victor could. "For a dragon fight? Hell yes. We'll be back next week. And we're bringing friends."

Victor smiled.

"Good."

***

**The Innovation**

That evening, Victor sat alone in his office, staring at projections.

Floor 5 was viable.

But barely profitable.

124 GP per run. Five runs per week. That was... 620 GP/week. 2,480 GP/month.

Enough to be sustainable.

Not enough to be transformational.

He pulled up a new model.

**What if Floor 5 wasn't just a dungeon floor?**

**What if it was a *competitive event*?**

> **CONCEPT: THE EMBER TRIALS**
>
> - Weekly ranked runs
> - Leaderboard (fastest clear time)
> - Grand prize: 500 GP (weekly)
> - Entry fee: 100 GP (unchanged)
> - Spectator tickets: 10 GP/person
>
> **Revenue Streams**:
>
> 1. Entry fees (10 parties x 100 GP = 1,000 GP/week)
> 2. Spectator admission (50 people x 10 GP = 500 GP/week)
> 3. Sponsorships (merchants advertising to adventurers = 300 GP/week)
> 4. Transport fees (Merchant's Guild = 8% of loot)
>
> **Total Weekly Revenue**: ~2,000 GP
> **Prize Payout**: -500 GP
> **Net Weekly Profit**: 1,500 GP (vs 620 GP current model)

> **[ARMI - INNOVATION MILESTONE]**
> Quest Complete: Stress Test & Tournament Model
> EXP Awarded: +800 (System Innovation)
> Total EXP: 17,785/17,750
> STATUS: **LEVEL UP** (8 → 9)
> Stat Points Allocated: +5 (INT+2, CHA+2, WIS+1)

The numbers worked.

Victor drafted an announcement:

---

> **DUNGEON INSOLVIA PRESENTS:**
>
> **THE EMBER TRIALS**
>
> Weekly Dragon Gauntlet - Competitive Dungeon Running
>
> **100 GP Entry | 500 GP Grand Prize**
>
> Fastest party to defeat Ignatia, the Ember Tyrant, wins.
>
> Leaderboards. Glory. Fame.
>
> *First Trial: Next Sixthday, Noon*

---

Valerius read it over Victor's shoulder.

"Boss... are you turning the dungeon into a *sport*?"

Victor leaned back.

"No. I'm turning it into a **brand**."

***

Down in Floor 5, Ignatia practiced her monologue for the third time.

She was workshopping new lines.

"Welcome, mortals" was good, but maybe "Behold, mortals" had better dramatic weight?

She'd ask Victor tomorrow.

This was the most fun she'd had in decades.
