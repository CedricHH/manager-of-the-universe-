# Chapter 53: The Selfless Act (Part 2)

**EARTH. THE SERVER ROOM.**

Seventy percent.

The progress bar crawled across the screen, pixel by agonizing pixel. Victor's eyes never left it. His hands rested motionless on the keyboard, ready to abort, ready to eject, ready to do whatever the calculation required.

The footsteps stopped.

Victor didn't move. Didn't breathe. Didn't allow his nervous system to waste resources on involuntary responses. He listened.

A door creaked somewhere to his left. The utility closet. The security guard was checking the adjacent room first — standard patrol protocol, if the guard was following procedure. Most guards followed procedure. Most guards were predictable.

Most.

Seventy-five percent.

Victor calculated. Time to completion at current transfer rate: approximately ninety seconds. Time until guard completed utility closet inspection and moved to server room: approximately sixty seconds. Probability of successful concealment if guard entered during download: forty-two percent. Probability of successful explanation if discovered: zero.

Options:

**Option A**: Abort download. Destroy drive. Exit through maintenance shaft. Waste six months of work. Forty-seven faces stay unavenged. Two hundred future faces join them.

**Option B**: Complete download. Risk detection. Risk everything.

The calculation hadn't changed. It was never going to change.

Eighty percent.

A flashlight beam swept under the server room door. Victor pressed himself against the server rack, the cold metal biting through his suit jacket. The light moved left to right, probing the darkness, searching for anomalies.

It passed.

The door didn't open.

Victor heard footsteps again — receding now, moving further down the corridor. The guard was continuing his patrol. The utility closet had been clean. The server room could wait for the next pass.

Lucky.

Victor didn't believe in luck. He believed in probability distributions. But sometimes, the distributions fell in your favor.

Eighty-five percent.

Victor allowed himself to breathe again. Shallow. Controlled. The way he'd taught himself during negotiations that went sideways.

---

Ninety. Ninety-five.

One hundred.

The progress bar filled. A soft chime sounded — the kind of noise that could get a man killed in an empty building at midnight. Victor jabbed the mute key and ejected the drive in one motion.

The thumb drive was warm in his hand. Sixteen gigabytes of corporate malfeasance. Every email. Every memo. Every wire transfer. Every boardroom confession that someone had helpfully recorded "for the record."

Forty-seven deaths, proven. Two hundred futures, protected.

Victor pocketed the drive. He didn't pause to reflect. Reflection was inefficient.

The main door was compromised — the guard would return in approximately twelve minutes, and the corridor had no cover. But Victor had mapped the building's maintenance infrastructure weeks ago, back when he'd first calculated the probability of this night becoming necessary.

The ventilation access panel was behind Server Rack 47. Victor had loosened the screws himself, during a "late night systems audit" that no one had questioned. He removed the panel, folded himself into the shaft, and pulled the panel back into place behind him.

The shaft was narrow. Dusty. Designed for HVAC technicians who were considerably smaller than Victor's six-foot-two frame. He crawled forward in darkness, navigating by memory and the faint vibration of the building's air handling system.

Left turn at the first junction. Straight for thirty meters. Right at the exhaust manifold. Down.

The drop was twelve feet. Victor landed in a crouch on the loading dock floor, his dress shoes scraping against industrial concrete. The parking garage was through the service entrance — twenty meters. His car was in Section C, near the stairwell. Forty-five minutes to the lawyers' office.

He walked. Not ran. Running attracted attention. Running suggested guilt.

Victor Kaine was guilty of a great many things. But tonight, for the first time in his life, he was also doing something *right*.

He still didn't call it that. "Right" was a moral judgment, and moral judgments were subjective. What he was doing was *optimal* — the solution that produced the best aggregate outcome across all measured variables.

It just happened to align with what most people called "right."

---

The drive took forty-three minutes.

Empty streets. Occasional traffic lights. A late-night city that didn't know its economy was about to experience a significant restructuring event.

Victor kept both hands on the wheel. The thumb drive sat in his jacket pocket. The folder — forty-seven photographs — rested on the passenger seat. He'd stopped looking at the faces weeks ago. He didn't need to. They were burned into whatever part of his brain processed things that couldn't be optimized away.

The radio was off. Victor preferred silence when he was calculating. And tonight, the calculations were particularly complex.

He thought about what would happen next.

The lawyers would receive the evidence tomorrow morning. They were employment attorneys representing the families of the Congolese workers — good lawyers, persistent lawyers, but lacking the resources to penetrate the board's defensive infrastructure. The thumb drive would change that. It would give them everything they needed.

Within forty-eight hours, the media would have leaks. Within seventy-two, regulators would have subpoenas. Within a week, the board would be testifying before congressional committees that they had previously *owned*.

And Victor?

Victor would be dead. Probably. The board had connections — government connections, corporate security connections, connections to people who made problems disappear without paperwork or bodies. Victor had calculated his survival probability at fifteen percent over the next thirty days.

Optimistic, really. He'd probably overestimated his own threat-avoidance capabilities. The board's security consultants were professionals. They would identify him as the leak within days. They would respond accordingly.

There was a certain peace in knowing that, actually. The uncertainty was gone. The only variable left was timing.

The question that other people might ask — "Why do this if you're going to die?" — wasn't a question Victor bothered with. The answer was obvious. The mathematics hadn't changed. One life (his) versus two hundred lives (theirs). The calculation made itself.

The only interesting variable was the feeling. Or rather, the absence of feeling.

Victor had expected... something. Fear, perhaps. Or righteousness. Or that strange heaviness people described when they talked about "doing the right thing." He'd read about these sensations in management psychology journals. He'd observed them in others — the trembling hands, the tearful confessions, the dramatic weight of moral decision-making.

He felt nothing.

Just the steering wheel under his hands. The drive in his pocket. The empty city passing by outside. The soft hum of the engine and the rhythm of streetlights sliding across the windshield.

This was just math. Cold, clean, emotionless math. And like all good calculations, it didn't require any feelings to be true.

**PRESENT DAY — TERRA-INSOLVIA**

"Boss? You had the faraway-eyes again."

Victor blinked. The Core Chamber. The dungeon. His employees.

Sniv stood at the stone table, clipboard clutched to his chest. Asterion loomed near the entrance, his greataxe resting against his shoulder. Zip crouched on a pile of scrolls, and Valerius had stopped pacing long enough to look genuinely concerned.

Nova's crystalline light painted everything in shades of blue and gold.

"The Prince arrives in sixty-eight hours," Victor said, as if he hadn't just been reliving a memory that killed him. "Let's discuss our presentation."

He looked at his team. The goblin who worshiped him. The minotaur who needed purpose. The kobold who counted synergies. The merchant who had bet on the wrong horse and now prayed it wouldn't throw him.

Monsters and misfits. Rejects and refugees. His employees.

*I died for strangers once*, Victor thought. *People I never met. People whose faces I memorized but whose names I never learned.*

The forty-seven.

*I wonder if I'd do it again.*

The thought was uncomfortable. It suggested that there was something in Victor Kaine beyond calculation — some anomaly in his decision-making architecture that couldn't be reduced to probability matrices and expected outcomes.

He dismissed the thought. It wasn't useful.

"Sniv, status report on documentation. Asterion, security protocols. Zip, I want a complete inventory of presentable assets. Valerius—" Victor paused, considering the nervous merchant. "Try not to look like you're about to vomit when the Prince arrives."

"I make no promises," Valerius said weakly.

Victor almost smiled.

> **[ARMI - PSYCHOLOGICAL AUDIT CONTINUED]**  
> Memory Integration Status: 68% complete.  
> Remaining Segments: The Delivery (lawyers' office), The Death (termination event).  
> Recommendation: Complete integration before high-stress acquisition operation.  
> Analysis: Unprocessed pre-reincarnation trauma degrades real-time decision-making by ~12%.  
> **Note**: You are avoiding the final memory. The Consortium recommends confrontation.

Victor dismissed the notification.

The Consortium could recommend whatever it wanted. He had a prince to acquire.

The rest of the story — the lawyers' office, the handoff, the inevitable consequence — could wait.

Or maybe it couldn't. Maybe the memory would surface whether he wanted it to or not.

But that was a problem for later.

Right now, sixty-eight hours. One prince. One opportunity.

The calculation was simple. The execution would be complex.

Victor Kaine had done the math before. He'd do it again.
