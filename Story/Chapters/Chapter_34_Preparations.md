# Chapter 34: Preparations

Victor assembled his leadership team in the office chamber with the efficiency of a man who'd run too many emergency board meetings to waste time on pleasantries.

Nova's crystal interface pulsed from the ceiling mount. Asterion stood near the wall, his massive frame casting shadows that suggested permanent structural damage. Sniv clutched his clipboard with the intensity of a drowning man holding driftwood. Krog—the alpha of the goblin guard units—shifted nervously near the doorway, uncertain why he'd been summoned to management-level discussions.

"I'll be gone for approximately one week," Victor began. "During this time, Sniv has operational authority. Asterion handles security. Nova monitors everything."

He projected calm. Inside, he was calculating the seventeen different ways this could fail catastrophically.

Sniv's hand shot up. "Boss... what if bad humans come?"

"The Iron Wolves are scheduled for their return visit in four days. Standard protocol applies. Charge the entry fees. Let them through. Don't kill unless provoked." Victor pulled up his mental operational manual. "Twenty Gold Pieces base rate, fifteen GP for Floor 3 access if they ask. Nova handles the transaction logging."

> **[NOVA]**
> CONFIRMED. PAYMENT PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHED.
> IRON WOLVES EXPEDITION FLAGGED IN CALENDAR.

Asterion's low rumble filled the chamber. "And if someone stronger comes? Someone without... scheduled appointments?"

Victor met the minotaur's gaze. "Nova will signal me via the Consortium link. But our profile is low. We're a minor dungeon in the middle of nowhere. No legendary treasures. No high-level boss advertising. No one knows this place matters yet."

"Yet," Asterion repeated, the word carrying weight.

"Yet," Victor confirmed.

He turned to Krog, who straightened reflexively under the attention. "Floor 2 patrols continue as scheduled. Goblins maintain the mushroom harvest rotation. Mining operations on Floor 3 run at seventy percent capacity—no overwork, no injuries. If something breaks, Zip's R&D team handles repairs. Questions?"

Krog shook his head so violently his ears flapped. "No questions, Boss! Krog do job! No break things!"

"Good. Dismissed."

The goblin fled with visible relief.

---

When the room contained only his core management, Victor allowed himself a moment of transparency.

"This is a risk," he said. "Leaving the dungeon while the Consortium knows I've accessed the black card. Traveling to a waypoint they control. Walking into what might be surveillance infrastructure disguised as a promotion ceremony."

Nova's interface brightened.

> **[NOVA - ANALYSIS]**
> RISK ASSESSMENT ACCURATE.
> PROBABILITY OF CONSORTIUM MONITORING: 87%.
> PROBABILITY OF COMPLICATIONS: 62%.
> RECOMMENDATION: CANCEL EXPEDITION.

"Recommendation denied." Victor pulled the black card from his pocket, the metallic surface gleaming under torchlight. "I can't stay at Restructurer Level 1 forever. Those encrypted files in the archive contain information I need. The processing codes. The harvest protocols. Maybe the locations of other Restructurers or Consortium assets."

"Knowledge is leverage," he continued. "And the Consortium has all of it while I'm operating blind. That ends in Oakhaven."

Asterion's eyes narrowed. "You're using their bait."

"I'm taking their bait and weaponizing it." Victor pocketed the card. "They expect compliance. I'll give them compliance—wrapped in enough misdirection that they won't see the hostile takeover until it's too late."

Sniv's voice came out small. "Boss... you come back, yes?"

The question landed harder than it should have.

Victor looked at the goblin. Sniv—Employee #1. The runt who'd signed a contract he couldn't read in exchange for a single meal. Who'd evolved from starving scavenger to COO through sheer desperate competence.

The rational response was simple: *"I always protect my investments."*

But something in Sniv's expression—the fear poorly hidden behind professional concern—made Victor pause.

He thought of Sarah. Of the drive. Of the rain.

"I always protect my investments, Sniv." The words came out softer than intended. "You're my investment."

Sniv's eyes went wide. Then he clutched the clipboard tighter and nodded so hard Victor worried about neck injuries.

"Sniv not fail! Sniv make Boss proud!"

"See that you do."

But the goblin didn't leave. He stood there, trembling, clipboard pressed to his chest like armor.

"Sniv?" Victor prompted.

"Boss is... good Boss." The words tumbled out in broken Common, raw and unfiltered. "Other bosses hit Sniv. Take Sniv food. Boss give food. Give job. Give... words that make sense." He tapped his skull. "Sniv brain work now. Sniv... Sniv want Boss safe."

Victor felt something twist in his chest. An inconvenient sensation. Inefficient.

He buried it.

"Your concern is noted and appreciated. Dismissed."

Sniv fled, but not from fear this time.

When the goblin was gone, Asterion spoke. "He would die for you."

"I know."

"Is that what you want?"

Victor didn't answer. Couldn't answer. Because the truth was complicated and unprofitable and felt too much like Project Cobalt—where good intentions and willful blindness had killed forty-seven people.

He changed the subject.

---

Disguises required preparation.

Victor couldn't walk into Oakhaven looking like a dungeon lord. He needed civilian cover. Something mundane. Something that explained why a human and a kobold were traveling together without triggering Adventurer's Guild interest.

> **[ARMI - COVER IDENTITY SUGGESTIONS]**
> Option 1: Traveling Merchant (Potions/Dungeon Goods)
> Option 2: Independent Scholar (Research Expedition)
> Option 3: Minor Noble (Slumming Incognito)
> Recommendation: Option 1 (Lowest Scrutiny Profile)

"Merchant it is." Victor pulled civilian clothing from his salvaged inventory—plain tunic, travel cloak, sturdy boots. Not the tailored suit he preferred, but functional. Unremarkable.

He needed a story. Needed products to sell. Needed documentation that would pass casual inspection.

"Zip!" he called.

The kobold appeared instantly, oversized goggles perched on his scaly head. "Boss call Zip?"

"We're traveling as potion traders. I need labels. Professional labels. Convincing enough to survive market district inspection but generic enough not to attract specialist attention."

Zip's eyes lit up with the manic enthusiasm of an engineer given creative freedom. "Zip make labels! Best labels! Very official! What potions Boss want?"

Victor considered. "Health potions—minor grade. Stamina tonics. Antidotes. Standard adventurer consumables. Use dungeon-sourced ingredients for legitimacy. Slime extract, mushroom concentrates, purified water from Floor 2 springs."

"Zip start now!" The kobold bounced excitedly. "Zip make merchant very convincing! Oakhaven people believe all lies—I mean, *truths*!"

Victor almost smiled. "You're coming with me. Small. Quiet. Good at urban navigation."

Zip's tail went rigid. "Zip go? Outside dungeon? To *city*?"

"Yes."

"With Boss?"

"Yes."

"Zip... Zip can talk?"

"Minimally. You're my assistant. Kobold labor is common in merchant operations. No one will question it as long as you don't set anything on fire or steal anything shiny."

Zip's claws fidgeted. "Zip... try not to steal shiny things."

"Trying isn't good enough. You *will not* steal. Understood?"

"Understood! Zip professional! Zip make Boss proud!" He paused. "What if shiny thing very, very shiny?"

"Then you will experience what I call 'performance-based severance.'"

Zip's enthusiasm dimmed to survivable levels. "Zip not steal. Zip promise."

"Good. Now make those labels. I need them by tomorrow morning."

The kobold scrambled away, already muttering about fonts and wax seals.

Inventory check.

Victor laid out his supplies on the desk with the precision of a man who'd optimized too many business trips:

- **50 Gold Pieces** (operating cash, carefully skimmed from dungeon revenue)
- **12 "Potion" Vials** (legitimately sourced dungeon consumables with Zip's forged labels)
- **R#1's Journal** (hidden in a locked case, for reference)
- **The Black Card** (most important item, concealed in an inner pocket)
- **Civilian Documentation** (travel papers, merchant license—both courtesy of Nova's archive forgery protocols)

Nova's voice crackled through the chamber.

> **[NOVA - SECURITY ADVISORY]**
> CONSORTIUM WAYPOINTS MAY BE MONITORED.
> ACTIVATION OF BLACK CARD WILL TRIGGER STATUS REPORT.
> YOUR LOCATION, PROGRESS, AND VAULT ACCESS WILL BE TRANSMITTED.
> RISK LEVEL: HIGH.

"That's a risk I have to take." Victor secured the supplies in a leather travel pack. "I can't stay blind forever. The Consortium has the map. I need to start drawing my own."

> **[NOVA]**
> ACKNOWLEDGED.
> RECOMMENDATION: MAINTAIN COMMUNICATION VIA ARMI LINK.
> I WILL MONITOR DUNGEON STATUS AND ALERT IF CRITICAL SITUATIONS DEVELOP.

"Agreed. If the dungeon faces existential threat, signal me immediately. Otherwise, Sniv and Asterion handle day-to-day operations."

> **[NOVA]**
> UNDERSTOOD.
> FINAL QUESTION: DO YOU TRUST THEM?

Victor paused.

Did he trust Sniv not to collapse under pressure? Did he trust Asterion not to revert to his boss-monster programming and slaughter the next adventurer party for sport?

Did he trust himself to come back?

"I trust that their survival depends on mine," Victor said. "That's more reliable than loyalty."

> **[NOVA]**
> ...THAT IS VERY SAD, VICTOR.

"It's very *practical*, Nova."

> **[NOVA]**
> THOSE ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

Victor didn't respond to that.

---

Dawn arrived too quickly.

Victor stood at the dungeon's hidden exit—a kobold-engineered access shaft Zip had discovered during Floor 2 renovations. It led to the surface. To open sky. To a world Victor hadn't seen since his resurrection.

Zip scrambled into the travel bag with theatrical enthusiasm, goggles askew, tools jangling.

"Zip ready! Zip quiet! Zip—"

"Quiet starts *now*."

The bag went silent save for muffled breathing.

Victor adjusted the pack on his shoulders. Checked the black card one final time. Felt the weight of fifty Gold Pieces and twelve fake potions and one very real journal containing the Last Will and Testament of a Restructurer who'd tried to save a world and died forgotten.

He wouldn't make the same mistake.

He wasn't trying to save Terra-Insolvia. He was trying to *own* it. And ownership required infrastructure. Intelligence. A hostile takeover of the very system that thought it owned him.

The Consortium had sent him to finish what Restructurer #1 refused to do.

They'd made a critical hiring error.

Victor climbed.

---

Sunlight hit him like a tax audit—sudden, blinding, unavoidable.

He stood on the surface for the first time since his resurrection. The dungeon entrance was disguised as a collapsed mine shaft, overgrown with moss and strategic foliage. Professional camouflage. Probably Nova's work.

The world stretched before him: forest, dirt road, distant mountains, and a sky so blue it looked photoshopped.

> **[ARMI - ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN]**
> Location: Tutorial Dungeon Surface Access
> Nearest Settlement: Oakhaven (2.7 days northeast)
> Weather: Clear
> Threats Detected: None (immediate vicinity)
> Recommendation: Proceed with caution

Victor looked back at the concealed entrance. Somewhere below, Sniv was clutching a clipboard. Asterion was patrolling Floor 4. Nova was monitoring systems. Twenty-six goblins were mining, foraging, guarding.

His dungeon. His company. His liability.

"First time leaving the office in weeks," he muttered. "Let's see what this world actually looks like."

From the travel bag, a muffled voice squeaked: "Zip see sky! Sky very big! Sky—"

Victor jostled the bag. "What did I say about quiet?"

The bag fell silent.

Victor turned toward the road. Toward Oakhaven. Toward the Consortium's waypoint and his "promotion" and whatever surveillance infrastructure waited to catalogue his compliance.

Behind him, the dungeon waited—silent, operational, vulnerable.

Ahead: civilization. Danger. The Consortium's attention.

And somewhere in between: leverage.

Victor walked.

The Manager of the Universe was going to see his territory.

And then he was going to take it.
