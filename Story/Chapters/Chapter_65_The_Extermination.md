# Chapter 65: The Extermination

The problem with embedded surveillance is that it only works if the target doesn't notice.

Victor stood on the observation deck, magnifying glass in hand, staring at one of the golden mosquitoes perched on a mana-rich vine. It pulsed faintly, glowing with the same warm light as freshly minted coins.

Beautiful, in a parasitic sort of way.

"Valerius," Victor said, not looking away from the insect. "Current loss estimate?"

The accountant flipped through his ledger, his face pale. "Each mosquito drains approximately 0.03% of the dungeon's ambient mana per hour. At current infestation levels—confirmed population of 87—we're bleeding 12.4 GP per day."

"Compounding?"

"Yes, Boss."

Victor did the math. Twelve GP/day didn't sound catastrophic. But compounding interest didn't care about human perception. Over a year, that was 4,526 GP extracted from his infrastructure without consent, without negotiation, and without a signed contract.

That was theft.

"And they're linked to the Bank?" Victor lowered the magnifying glass.

"Confirmed," Valerius nodded. "I cross-referenced the mana signature with the loan documents. The mosquitoes are legally classified as 'Financial Monitoring Sprites.' Section 47-C of the Fine Print. 'Lender reserves the right to install magical oversight mechanisms to ensure asset preservation.'"

Victor smiled, but there was no warmth in it. "Did Malcom really think I wouldn't read the fine print?"

"Most clients don't, Boss."

"Most clients aren't me."

Down below, Sir Roland stood at the entrance to Floor 4, arms crossed. He had been watching the mosquitoes for the past ten minutes, his expression unreadable.

Victor leaned over the railing. "Officer! Question for you."

Roland looked up. "Heretic."

"Are those unlicensed magical constructs?"

There was a pause. Roland pulled out his compliance manual—a massive tome bound in steel and sanctified leather. He flipped through pages with bureaucratic precision.

"Definition: Magical Construct," Roland read aloud. "Any entity created, summoned, or deployed via spell, ritual, or enchantment that operates autonomously within Crown-regulated territory."

He looked up at the mosquitoes. One buzzed past his helmet.

"Yes," Roland concluded. "These are Class-C Magical Vermin. Unlicensed."

Victor's smile widened. "And what's the penalty for deploying unlicensed constructs in a regulated dungeon?"

Roland flipped more pages. "Immediate containment. Submission of Pest Control Form 38-B within 72 hours. Failure to comply results in a 500 GP fine and suspension of operational permits."

"Good to know," Victor nodded. "I'll file the paperwork."

Roland's eyes narrowed. "Are you planning to kill them?"

"No," Victor said honestly. "I'm planning to *relocate* them."

***

**The Capture Operation**

Sniv held a butterfly net. It was enchanted—woven from spider silk and copper wire—and cost 15 GP from the Merchant Quarter.

"Boss want Sniv to catch... bugs?" Sniv asked, confused.

"Correct," Victor said. "Non-lethally. We need one intact for analysis."

Gorg crouched nearby, massive hands cupped together. "Gorg try clap method?"

"No clapping," Victor said firmly. "That will trigger the self-destruct clause."

"Self... destruct?" Gorg blinked.

Valerius held up the loan contract, pointing to a sub-clause written in font size 4. "If the monitoring sprites are tampered with, the Bank can claim breach of contract and trigger early repayment. All 10,000 GP. Due immediately."

Gorg whistled low. "Bank very sneaky."

"Bank is competent," Victor corrected. "Which makes them dangerous."

Sniv crept forward, net raised. A golden mosquito hovered near a cluster of glowing orchids, its proboscis buried in a flower's mana reservoir.

Sniv swung.

The net came down cleanly. The mosquito buzzed, struggling, but didn't explode.

"Got one!" Sniv cheered.

"Good," Victor motioned. "Bring it to the workshop."

***

**The Dissection**

Valerius laid the captured mosquito on a stone table, surrounded by detection runes and anti-magic dampeners. It buzzed weakly, wings fluttering against the silk netting.

"Alright," Valerius pulled on a pair of enchanted gloves. "Let's see what you're made of."

He cast **[Arcane Autopsy]**—a diagnostic spell typically used on cursed items. The mosquito's internal structure appeared as a glowing schematic in the air above the table.

Victor studied it.

The insect had three distinct magical cores:

1. **Mana Extraction Node** (Proboscis) - Siphons 0.03% mana/hour.
2. **Data Transmission Core** (Thorax) - Reports location, profitability, operational status to the Bank.
3. **Self-Destruct Trigger** (Abdomen) - Detonates if removed, killed, or magically suppressed.

"It's a tripwire," Victor muttered. "Kill one, and Malcom gets an alert. Kill all of them, and he triggers the repayment clause."

"We're trapped?" Valerius whispered.

"No," Victor said. "We're *incentivized*. There's a difference."

Victor pulled up his mental interface.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Threat Assessment: Financial Parasites**
> **Current Loss Rate**: 12.4 GP/day
> **Projected Annual Loss**: 4,526 GP
> **Contract Breach Risk**: 94% (if sprites terminated)
> **Status**: CRITICAL - COMPLIANCE SOLUTION REQUIRED

He stared at the schematic for another thirty seconds, running scenarios. Three options emerged:

**Option A**: Kill the mosquitoes. Probability of contract breach: 94%. Expected penalty: 10,000 GP immediate repayment + legal fees. ROI: Negative 15,000 GP.

**Option B**: Ignore the mosquitoes. Probability of sustained losses: 100%. Expected damage over loan term: 4,526 GP. ROI: Negative 4,500 GP.

**Option C**: Exploit a legal loophole. Probability of success: 67%. Expected cost: Minimal. Potential gain: 500 GP interest waiver. ROI: Positive 1,200 GP.

Option C wasn't the safest choice. But it was the most *efficient*.

Then he smiled.

"Valerius. Get me Roland. And draft a formal complaint."

"A... complaint?"

"Yes. I'm filing a grievance with the Crown Compliance Office."

***

**The Bureaucratic Gambit**

Thirty minutes later, Sir Roland stood in the workshop, reading the document Victor had handed him.

**FORMAL COMPLAINT – MAGICAL PEST INFESTATION**

**Filed By**: Victor Kaine, Administrator of Dungeon Insolvia
**Violation**: Unlicensed Deployment of Class-C Magical Constructs
**Statute**: Magical Pest Control Act of 1447, Section 12

**Relief Requested**:
- Authorization to relocate invasive magical species to designated containment zone
- Waiver of liability for any "incidental disruption" to third-party monitoring systems
- 72-hour compliance window per standard procedure

Roland read it twice.

"You're not killing them," he said slowly. "You're *relocating* them."

"Correct. To a jar."

"A jar?"

Victor held up a small glass container, enchanted with preservation runes. "They can still monitor. They just can't extract. Technically compliant with the loan terms. 'Lender may install oversight mechanisms.' It doesn't specify *where*."

Roland stared at the jar. Then at the complaint. Then at Victor.

"This is absurd."

"This is *legal*," Victor corrected. "Do I have authorization or not?"

Roland pulled out a stamp—an official seal of the Crown Compliance Office. He hesitated for only a moment.

Then he stamped the document.

**APPROVED.**

"You have 72 hours," Roland said. "But if the Bank objects, this goes to Crown Court."

"Let them object," Victor said. "I'll see them there."

***

**The Counter-Proposal**

Victor didn't wait.

He drafted a letter—formal, professional, and utterly ruthless—and sent it via express magical pigeon to the Gilded Ledger.

---

**TO**: Director Malcom, Senior Loans Officer
**FROM**: Victor Kaine, Administrator
**RE**: Pest Relocation Notice

Director Malcom,

I am writing to inform you of a compliance issue regarding your recent loan.

The "Financial Monitoring Sprites" deployed as part of the loan agreement have been flagged by Crown Compliance Officer Sir Roland as **unlicensed magical constructs** in violation of the Magical Pest Control Act of 1447.

Per Crown Law, I am required to relocate these entities to a designated containment zone within 72 hours.

I have enclosed a proposal:

1. Reduce sprite population by 80% (voluntary recall by the Bank).
2. Remaining sprites (20%) will monitor only—**extraction capability disabled**.
3. In exchange, I will not pursue legal action for unlicensed surveillance.

**Additional Consideration**: Waive the first quarter's compound interest (500 GP).

Failure to respond within 24 hours will result in full relocation and a formal complaint filed with the Banking Regulatory Commission.

I trust we can resolve this amicably.

Regards,
Victor Kaine

Victor sealed the letter with wax and attached it to the pigeon's leg.

"Fly fast," he told the bird.

It took off, disappearing into the sky.

Valerius stared. "Boss... you just threatened the Bank."

"No," Victor corrected. "I just gave them an exit strategy."

***

**The Response**

Twelve hours later, a return pigeon landed.

The letter was brief.

---

**FROM**: Director Malcom
**TO**: Mr. Kaine

Your complaint has been reviewed.

The "Financial Monitoring Sprites" were installed per standard operating procedure. However, we acknowledge certain... *territorial compliance issues*.

Proposal accepted:
- 80% sprite recall (effective immediately)
- Remaining sprites: monitoring only, no extraction
- First quarter compound interest: **waived** (500 GP credit applied)

Consider this matter closed.

We look forward to continued partnership.

— M.

Victor read it twice.

Then he laughed—short, sharp, and genuine.

"He blinked."

Valerius was stunned. "The Bank... *negotiated*?"

"He had no choice," Victor explained. "If this went to Crown Court, it would set a precedent. Every dungeon, every merchant, every noble with a Bank loan would start auditing for illegal magical surveillance. The Church would have used it to justify audits on *every* financial institution in the kingdom."

"So he cut his losses," Valerius whispered.

"Exactly," Victor nodded. "Malcom is competent. He knows when to retreat."

By sunset, the mosquito population had dropped to 15. The remaining sprites hovered passively, their extraction nodes visibly deactivated. Roland inspected each one personally, using a mana detector to verify compliance.

"They're clean," Roland confirmed, sounding almost disappointed.

"Good," Victor said. "File the closure report."

***

**The Cliffhanger**

That night, Victor sat in his office, inventorying the captured mosquitoes. Seventy-two were contained in preservation jars, their golden bodies frozen mid-flight.

"What do we do with them, Boss?" Valerius asked.

Victor picked up one jar, holding it to the light.

The mosquito inside shimmered. And in its abdomen, beneath the self-destruct core, was something else.

A tiny, crystallized mana fragment.

Worth approximately 5 GP.

Victor did the math.

72 mosquitoes x 5 GP = 360 GP.

"They weren't just surveillance," Victor said softly. "They were also... *loot*."

Valerius blinked. "The Bank gave us a renewable resource?"

"By accident, yes," Victor smiled. "They planted money-bugs in my dungeon thinking they'd extract value. Instead, they gave me harvestable assets."

He set the jar down and turned to Sniv.

"Start a mosquito farm. Breeding program. If the Bank wants to plant financial parasites in my infrastructure, I'm going to *cultivate* them."

Sniv's eyes lit up. "Sniv farm the bugs! Sniv good at farming!"

"Excellent," Victor said. "Get started."

As Sniv scurried off, muttering about cage designs and mana fertilizer, a new pigeon landed on the windowsill.

Victor unrolled the message.

It was short. One sentence.

> *"Clever. But you just made it personal."*
> *— M.*

Victor crumpled the note.

Then he smiled.

"Good. Personal is profitable."

Down in the jungle, the remaining fifteen monitoring sprites watched silently.

And in a vault beneath the city, Director Malcom closed a ledger and opened a different one.

The game had changed.
