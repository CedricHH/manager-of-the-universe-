Asterion’s head tilted. The massive horns, sharp enough to core a castle wall, swept through the air. "Underpaid... lease? You use words that taste like dry parchment, human. But I follow the scent. You say the Core has failed me."

"The Core hasn't failed you," Victor corrected, a sliver of ice in his tone. "The Core is a set of hardcoded protocols. It does what it was designed to do: generate threats and manage assets. It’s an operating system, Asterion. And you’ve been running a Legacy Build for two centuries."

Victor stepped around a jagged piece of masonry, his eyes never leaving the Minotaur’s. 

"The dungeon world is changing. The 'Hero and Boss' model is undergoing a massive market correction. Parties are getting more professional. They have better gear, better intel, better healers. Eventually, a group will come that you can't just 'roar' away. And when they kill you, you'll respawn, and the Cycle will repeat. Forever. No growth. No dividends. Just a 1:1 ratio of misery."

Asterion snorted, a wet, heavy sound. "And you? You are but a Level One fluke. A 'Manager' with no mana and a tongue of silver. Why should I listen to a fruit that hasn't even ripened?"

"Because," Victor said, and for the first time, he let a small, predatory smile touch his lips. "I’m the only one here who knows how to scale this operation. You kill me now, you get a snack. You keep me alive, you get a career."

Victor gestured to the surrounding shadows, where a dozen pairs of goblin eyes hovered in the gloom.

"I’m restructuring this dungeon. We are moving from a 'Survival-Based Model' to a 'Revenue-Based Experience.' We aren't just here to kill adventurers; we are here to harvest them. And a harvest needs security. It needs a General. Someone who understands tactical deployment. Someone who isn't just a monster behind a door, but a leader of a multi-floor defense network."

Asterion stared at him. The silence stretched, thick with the smell of damp earth and the heavy thrum of the Dungeon Core somewhere below. 

**"Chief... Security... Officer,"** the Minotaur rumbled, testing the words. They sounded ridiculous coming from him, yet they held a weight of authority that 'Floor Boss' never had.

"Precisely," Victor said. "CSO. You would be responsible for the security of the entire regional corridor. Training the next generation of entities. Coordinating the 'performances.' In exchange, you get more than just tribute. You get equity."

"Equity," Asterion breathed. "More riddles."

"A share of the profit," Victor simplified. "Gold. Recognition. And most importantly... structure. A reason to stand in this room that isn't just because a Core told you to."

Victor reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, glowing shard—a bit of pyritized mana he’d salvaged earlier. He held it out on his flat palm.

"This is a down payment. A signing bonus. Take it, and we begin the onboarding process. Refuse, and you can go back to waiting another two hundred years for someone to ask your name."

Asterion’s giant hand hovered over the tiny shard. His claws were the size of daggers, his skin like weathered leather. 

Slowly, his fingers closed around the mana shard. He didn't crush it. He just held it.

**"The small green one calls you 'Boss',"** Asterion said, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous hum. **"He is foolish. But he is well-fed. If this... 'onboarding'... fails to satisfy, Manager, I will find a very professional use for your skull."**

"I’d expect nothing less from my new CSO," Victor said, his pulse finally beginning to settle. "Now, let's talk about your benefits package. We’ll start with the grievance policy."
