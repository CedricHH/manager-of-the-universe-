# Chapter 102: The Recruitment

Three days after the expansion plan.

Victor moved through the Market Quarter like a ghost.

The hooded cloak suppressed most of his mana signature, and ARMI's stealth protocol handled the rest. To casual observers, he was just another traveler browsing the morning markets. To anyone with Restructurer-level perception, he was a carefully controlled absence.

The mystery signal pulsed ahead.

> **[ARMI - MARKET INTELLIGENCE]**
> Quest: [Market Intelligence]
> Objective: Identify unknown Restructurer-class mana source
> 
> **Tracking Protocol**: ACTIVE
> Signal Strength: 34% (intermittent)
> Last Detection: Market Quarter, Alchemist Supply Shop
> Distance: 200 meters

Victor followed the thread through the crowd. Merchants hawking bread. Adventurers haggling over equipment. Beggars working their corners. The Market Quarter at dawn was a symphony of transactions, each one a tiny data point in Oakhaven's economic ecosystem.

The signal led to a narrow shop wedged between a blacksmith and a jeweler: *Thorne's Alchemical Supplies*.

Victor stopped across the street, pretending to examine a fruit vendor's apples.

Through the shop window, he saw her.

Young woman. Mid-twenties. Traveling merchant's clothes—practical leather, no ornamentation. She moved through the ingredient displays with surgical precision. Not browsing. Analyzing.

She picked up a slime core sample from the discount bin.

Inspected it under the light.

Set it down.

Victor's ARMI interface pulsed.

> **[ARMI - ANALYSIS]**
> Target: Female, estimated Level 15-18
> Behavior Pattern: Institutional reconnaissance
> Probability of Restructurer classification: 87%

Then she turned and looked directly at him through the crowd.

Smiled.

The mana signature vanished like a candle snuffed out. Suppressed. Just like his.

She walked to the shop's back exit and disappeared into an alley.

Victor stood perfectly still.

She'd known he was tracking her. She'd wanted him to find her. And now she was testing whether he'd follow.

He checked the time. Forty-three minutes until his first recruitment interview.

**Decision**: Not today.

The mystery Restructurer could wait. Victor had infrastructure to build.

He turned and walked back toward the dungeon.

Behind him, in the alley's shadows, a woman watched him leave.

"Smart," she murmured. "He doesn't chase bait."

She pulled out a small crystal—an ARMI interface, different model than Victor's—and typed a note.

> Subject assessment: Tactical discipline exceeds file projection. Proceeding to Phase 2.

---

The conference room felt too small for Asterion's bulk, but the minotaur had learned to navigate human-sized furniture. Sniv sat to Victor's left, clipboard ready, spectacles gleaming.

Across the table: Marcus Thiel.

Age thirty-four. Former Merchant Guild journeyman. Twelve years of experience, according to the application Sniv had somehow acquired through channels Victor didn't ask about.

Marcus looked nervous. Not terrified—Victor had seen terrified. This was the controlled anxiety of a man who knew he was gambling his career.

"Mr. Thiel," Victor began. "You've worked for the Merchant Guild for how long?"

"Twelve years. Since my apprenticeship."

"Current salary?"

"Fifty gold per month. Plus lodging in the Guild dormitory."

Victor pulled up an ARMI projection between them—a hovering display of numbers that made Marcus's eyes widen.

> **Comparative Analysis: Alchemist Compensation**
> 
> **Guild Standard (Journeyman)**:
> - Salary: 50 GP/month
> - Hours: 70-80/week (no overtime pay)
> - Benefits: Dormitory bed, meal rations
> - Profit sharing: 0%
> - Retirement: Guild pension (if you survive 30 years)
> 
> **Insolvia Apothecary Offer**:
> - Salary: 150 GP/month (3x industry standard)
> - Hours: 60/week maximum (6-day, 10-hour shifts)
> - Benefits: Private housing stipend (20 GP/month), meal allowance
> - Profit sharing: 1% of shop revenue
> - Severance package: 6 months salary if terminated without cause

Marcus stared at the numbers.

"This is... triple what Lysander pays."

"Correct."

"Why?"

"Because I need the best alchemists in Oakhaven, and the best alchemists currently work for a monopoly that underpays them. I'm correcting a market inefficiency."

Marcus leaned back. His hands trembled slightly. "If I defect, the Guild will blacklist me. I'll never work in this city again."

"In eight weeks," Victor said, voice flat, factual, "I will own the Guild. You're not defecting. You're getting in on the ground floor."

Silence.

"You're serious."

"I don't make jokes about acquisitions."

Another projection appeared—this one showing production costs.

> **Potion Economics**
> 
> **Guild Production Cost/Unit**: 8 silver
> **Insolvia Production Cost/Unit**: 3 silver (slime-core advantage)
> 
> **Market Pricing**:
> - Current Guild price: 50 silver
> - Insolvia launch price: 10 silver (80% undercut)
> 
> **Profit Margins**:
> - Guild margin at 10 silver/unit: **-200%** (bankruptcy)
> - Insolvia margin at 10 silver/unit: **+233%** (sustainable)

Marcus's eyes tracked the numbers. Victor could see the moment comprehension hit.

"You're going to price them into the ground."

"I'm going to give them a choice: work for me, or starve. You're choosing now, before the collapse. That's smart."

"What if..." Marcus hesitated. "What if Lysander retaliates? Violently?"

Victor gestured to Asterion. The minotaur stood—all eight feet and four hundred pounds of muscle.

"This is Asterion, head of security. He has twelve additional guards stationed at the apothecary location. The slime farm is inside the dungeon, protected by five floors of defensive infrastructure. And I have forty-two professional soldiers on retainer."

Marcus swallowed.

"When I said I'm acquiring the Guild," Victor continued, "I meant I've already calculated how Lysander will respond. Violence is expensive. Violence against fortified positions with superior funding is suicide. He'll try a price war first. Then sabotage. Then legal action. By the time he considers armed conflict, he'll be bankrupt."

"And if I join you, I'm part of that plan."

"You're part of the winning side."

Marcus looked at the contract Sniv slid across the table. Standard employment agreement, reviewed by Victor's hired legal consultant. Two-year term. Non-compete clause that only activated if Marcus voluntarily left. Profit-sharing vesting after six months.

He picked up the quill.

"Where do I sign?"

---

> **[ARMI]**
> New Employee: Marcus Thiel (Alchemist, Level 8)
> Salary: 150 GP/month
> Specialization: Health potions, mana potions, basic curatives
> Production Capacity: 40 potions/day
> 
> **Employment Contract**: BINDING (2-year term)
> **Cost**: 1,800 GP/year salary + 240 GP/year housing = 2,040 GP total
> **Projected Revenue Contribution**: 14,000 GP/year (assumes 40 potions/day at 7 GP profit)
> **ROI**: 686%

Victor dismissed the notification as Marcus left.

"Two more alchemists," he said to Sniv. "Interviews this afternoon."

The goblin consulted his list. "Sniv has three candidates! Very qualified! None have tried to eat Sniv yet!"

"Excellent. Asterion, security update?"

The minotaur produced a rolled parchment—a floor plan of the apothecary site.

"Construction is on schedule. Walls reinforced. Anti-scrying wards installed. I've hired twelve guards. Three per eight-hour shift."

"Experience level?"

"Mix of ex-military and dungeon veterans. All Level 10 or higher. All understand the rules of engagement: non-lethal unless directly threatened with lethal force."

Victor studied the floor plan. Perimeter defenses. Panic room for high-value inventory. Emergency escape tunnels leading back to the dungeon.

"What about the slime farm?"

"Inside Floor 2. Anyone trying to sabotage it would have to fight through Nova's dungeon floors. Low probability of success."

"And the mystery Restructurer?"

Asterion's expression didn't change, but his tone sharpened. "Unknown variable. You said you saw her this morning?"

"Briefly. Young woman, mid-twenties. She knew I was tracking her. She's watching me, I'm watching her. We're both waiting to see who moves first."

"Enemy?"

"Unknown. Could be competitor. Could be Consortium oversight. Could be something else entirely."

"And if she moves against the operation?"

Victor's smile was thin. "Then we'll find out if the Consortium trains Restructurers to compete or cooperate."

An ARMI notification interrupted them.

> **[ARMI - CONSTRUCTION UPDATE]**
> Asset: Automated Slime Farm Alpha
> Status: 87% complete
> First Harvest: 2 days
> Projected Output: 2,000 cores/week (on target)
> Maintenance Cost: 200 GP/week

"Two days until we have product," Victor said. "One week until Marcus and the other alchemists start production. Two weeks until we open the shop."

"And then?" Asterion asked.

"Then Lysander finds out what happens when someone calls me an amateur."

---

Floor 1 of the dungeon had been converted into what Sniv called the "Customer Service Academy."

Ten goblins sat in makeshift chairs, facing a chalkboard where Sniv had drawn helpful diagrams. The diagrams were mostly stick figures and incomprehensible symbols, but the goblins nodded enthusiastically.

Victor watched from the elevated walkway, arms crossed.

"Module One!" Sniv announced, tapping the chalkboard with his pointer stick. "Greet the asset—I mean, **customer**!"

The goblins recited in unison: "WELCOME TO BOSS'S HEALING JUICE PLACE!"

Sniv's ears drooped. "No, no, no. Is 'Insolvia Apothecary.' Not 'healing juice place.' Try again!"

"INSOLVIA... APOC... APOTH..."

"Close enough!" Sniv made a checkmark on his clipboard. "Module Two: **No eating the customers.**"

One goblin raised a hand. "What if customer is very small? And smells delicious?"

"NO. EATING. Even if delicious."

The goblin looked disappointed but nodded.

"Module Three!" Sniv paced in front of the class like a drill sergeant. "Upselling techniques! If customer buys one potion, you say: 'Would you like to add value with SECOND potion?'"

A goblin in the back row tried: "Would you like MORE HEALING before you DIE?"

Sniv paused. Considered. "...Close enough. Shows urgency. Good salesmanship!"

Victor made a mental note: Sniv had evolved from starving runt to middle manager training retail staff.

The ROI on that original contract was incalculable.

Sniv noticed him watching and scurried over, clipboard clutched to his chest.

"Boss! Boss! Training is going very well! Only two incidents!"

"Define 'incidents.'"

"One goblin tried to eat training dummy. One goblin tried to sell training dummy a potion. Both show entrepreneurial spirit!"

"Graduation timeline?"

"Four days! Goblins will be ready for customer interface! Sniv guarantees zero fatalities!"

"Zero customer fatalities, or zero goblin fatalities?"

Sniv's face scrunched in thought. "...Sniv will clarify success metrics."

Victor almost smiled. "Good. Report to me when they're ready."

He left Sniv to his training and headed for the Market Quarter construction site.

---

The future Insolvia Apothecary sat in a prime location: corner of Market Row and Healer's Lane. High foot traffic. Visible from three directions. Close enough to the Adventurer's Guild to catch post-dungeon traffic.

Asterion was already there, reviewing security installations with the lead contractor.

Victor joined him inside. The walls were reinforced stone, two feet thick. The windows had iron shutters. The back room—where potions would be stored—had a vault door salvaged from a defunct bank.

"Overkill?" Victor asked.

"Not if Lysander sends professionals."

They walked the perimeter. Three guards currently on duty, watching the construction. All armed. All alert.

"What's your threat assessment?" Victor asked.

"Phase one: Lysander sends thugs to intimidate workers. Low-level harassment. We repel easily."

"Phase two?"

"Sabotage. Arson attempts. Poisoning the water supply. We counter with wards and patrols."

"Phase three?"

Asterion's voice lowered. "Professional killers. Not guild enforcers. Real talent. That's when it gets expensive."

"For him or for us?"

"Both. But you have deeper pockets."

Victor walked to the front window, looking out at the Market Quarter. Somewhere out there, the mystery Restructurer was watching. Waiting.

"Asterion. Hypothetical question."

"Yes?"

"If another Restructurer is operating in this city, and she's not competing for the Guild target, what is she here for?"

The minotaur considered. "Oversight. Evaluation. Recruitment."

"Those were my conclusions."

"Which means she's not your enemy."

"Not yet." Victor turned from the window. "But the Consortium doesn't send evaluators unless someone's performance is worth evaluating. Either I've impressed them, or I've concerned them."

"And you don't know which."

"I will. Soon."

They finished the security audit in silence.

---

Victor returned to the Core Chamber as the sun set.

The day's work played out in mental ledgers:

- 1 alchemist hired (2 more interviews tomorrow)
- 10 goblins in training (4 days until deployment)
- Security installation 90% complete
- Slime farm 87% complete (first harvest in 48 hours)
- Mystery Restructurer: status unchanged

Acceptable progress.

He was reviewing projected expenses when ARMI pulsed an alert. Not a standard notification—this one carried Consortium encryption protocols.

> **[ARMI - PRIORITY MESSAGE]**
> Source: UNKNOWN RESTRUCTURER
> Encryption: Consortium Standard Protocol
> 
> **MESSAGE RECEIVED**:
> 
> To: Restructurer #REDACTED (Victor Kaine)
> From: Restructurer #418 (Designation: Liaison)
> 
> **Subject**: Territorial Introduction
> 
> You're not subtle. Neither am I.
> 
> Meet me at the Broken Barrel Inn, tomorrow, noon.
> Come alone. Bring your ARMI interface.
> 
> I'm not here to compete. I'm here to *evaluate*.
> 
> - Kira

Victor read the message three times.

She knew his Restructurer ID number—that required Consortium-level clearance.

Her designation was "Liaison," not "Operator." Oversight, not acquisition.

She was evaluating him. For what? Promotion? Audit? Termination?

And she'd signed her name. Confidence. Or bait.

Probability matrix assembled itself:

- Trap: 23%
- Genuine Consortium oversight: 54%
- Recruitment for larger operation: 18%
- Unknown third option: 5%

Victor pulled up his calendar. Tomorrow, noon. He had a second alchemist interview at 10 AM and a building inspection at 2 PM.

He could fit in a meeting.

Three options:

1. **Attend alone** (risky, information-rich)
2. **Ignore the message** (safe, loses intelligence)
3. **Send a proxy** (cowardly, reveals weakness)

He dismissed options two and three immediately.

If the Consortium sent an evaluator, he'd meet her. On her terms, initially. Then on his.

Victor composed a reply:

> Accepted. Noon. Broken Barrel. Alone.
> 
> Fair warning: I don't take orders well.
> 
> - V.K.

He sent it.

The response came thirty seconds later:

> Good. Neither do I.
> See you tomorrow, Chainsaw.

Victor stared at the nickname. She'd done her research.

He leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled.

Tomorrow, he'd meet Restructurer #418. Tonight, he'd prepare for every possible outcome.

A final ARMI notification pulsed:

> **[ARMI - QUEST UPDATE]**
> Quest: [Market Intelligence]
> Status: PROGRESSING → CRITICAL PHASE
> New Objective: Survive meeting with Restructurer #418 (Kira)
> Reward: Intelligence on Consortium operations + Potential alliance
> Risk Level: MODERATE-HIGH
> 
> **Advisory**: Liaison-class Restructurers have termination authority.
> Recommendation: Bring leverage.

Victor dismissed the warning.

He'd built a million-gold empire in twenty-three days.

He'd survived Church inquisitors, Imperial customs, and Executor-level audits.

One evaluator with a superiority complex?

That was just another negotiation.

And Victor Kaine didn't lose negotiations.
