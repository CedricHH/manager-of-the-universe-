# Chapter 102 - The Recruitment

Three days of surveillance had taught Victor two things about the mystery Restructurer.

First: she was watching him.

Second: she wanted him to know it.

The Market Quarter smelled like commerce—sawdust, spice, and desperation. Victor moved through the morning crowd with practiced anonymity: hooded cloak, suppressed mana signature, gait adjusted to match common laborers. ARMI's tracking protocol pulsed against his consciousness, a subtle pressure behind his eyes.

> **[ARMI - MARKET INTELLIGENCE]**
> Quest: [Market Intelligence]
> Objective: Identify unknown Restructurer-class mana source
> 
> **Tracking Protocol**: ACTIVE
> Signal Strength: 34% (intermittent)
> Last Detection: Market Quarter, Alchemist Supply Shop
> Distance: 200 meters
> 
> Status: APPROACHING SIGNAL

The trail led to a narrow shop squeezed between a potter's stall and a closed tavern. Hand-painted sign: *Thornwick's Alchemical Supplies*. Legitimate business. Low traffic. Perfect surveillance position overlooking the Market Quarter's main thoroughfare.

Victor stopped at a spice vendor across the street. Purchased cinnamon he didn't need. Watched the shop's entrance.

Seventeen minutes. Then she emerged.

Mid-twenties. Travel-worn clothing, merchant guild colors, leather pack suggesting long-distance trade. Nothing remarkable. Everything calculated.

She walked to a display of slime cores. Picked one up. Examined it with the precision of someone analyzing asset quality, not ingredient value.

Then she looked directly at Victor through the crowd.

Smiled.

The mana signature vanished—suppressed, controlled, *intentional*. Professional-grade concealment. Consortium training.

She turned and walked toward the opposite exit.

Victor calculated pursuit probability. Seventy-three percent this was bait. Twenty-two percent genuine contact attempt. Five percent coincidence.

He dismissed the five percent immediately. The Consortium didn't do coincidences.

The woman disappeared into the alley networks behind the Market Quarter. Victor didn't follow.

If she wanted contact, she'd initiate properly. If she wanted competition, she'd reveal intent. If she wanted surveillance... well. Two could play that game.

Victor purchased his cinnamon and returned to the dungeon.

Operations required oversight. The mystery Restructurer could wait.

The Potion R&D Division occupied the western annex of Floor 3—a converted armory that now housed alembics, distillation columns, and seventeen alchemists who'd learned to prefer Victor's management style to Mordecai Groll's.

Marcus Thiel stood at a workbench, reviewing production schedules. Thirty-four years old, twelve years' experience, promoted from journeyman to operations lead because he could read spreadsheets and follow instructions without requiring motivational violence.

"Marcus," Victor said.

The alchemist looked up. Set down his quill. "Mr. Kaine."

"Walk with me."

They moved to a side office—formerly a weapons locker, now converted to Victor's secondary workspace. ARMI projection surfaces lined two walls. Financial charts dominated the display.

"I'm expanding operations," Victor began. No preamble; Marcus preferred directness. "Insolvia Apothecary. Storefront operation at the dungeon entrance. Direct consumer sales."

"Bypassing the Merchant Guild licensing," Marcus said immediately. The man understood market structure.

"Precisely. I need production capacity of two thousand potions per week minimum, scaling to four thousand by Week 3."

"That's triple our current output."

"Which is why I'm offering you a promotion. Apothecary Operations Lead. You'll manage production, quality control, and distribution logistics."

Marcus's expression didn't change, but his posture shifted—the subtle recalculation of someone reassessing their position. "Salary?"

"One hundred fifty GP per month. Triple your current rate. Housing stipend, meal allowance, and one percent profit share on gross apothecary revenue."

"One percent."

"Of revenue, not profit. The percentage compounds as we scale."

Victor pulled up the financial projection. Conservative estimates showed monthly apothecary revenue of four thousand GP within twelve weeks. One percent would net Marcus forty GP monthly—more than most journeyman alchemists earned in six months.

"You're targeting the Merchant Guild," Marcus said slowly.

"I'm offering consumers a non-Guild alternative priced fifteen percent below market standard. The Guild's response is irrelevant to your compensation structure."

"Lysander Corvus is thirty-eight years in power. He has Crown connections. Political leverage."

"Lysander profits from regulatory capture, not competition. Crown Territory exemptions make his licensing structure legally irrelevant. I'm not breaking his monopoly. I'm circumventing it entirely."

Marcus stared at the projection. Victor let him calculate. Smart employees didn't need persuasion; they needed data.

"Lysander will pressure the Crown to close the loophole," Marcus finally said.

"Which requires legislative action. Legislation requires political capital. Political capital costs money when you're fighting twelve thousand adventurers who save forty silver per transaction shopping at my store."

Marcus's eyes widened fractionally—the only indication of surprise he'd shown. "You're building a voting constituency."

"I'm building a market. The constituency is a natural byproduct of competitive pricing."

Silence. Marcus's fingers drummed against the workbench—an unconscious tell Victor had cataloged weeks ago. The man was calculating risk versus reward.

"What happens when Lysander escalates?" Marcus asked.

"Then we discover whether three decades of monopoly behavior prepares someone for actual economic warfare."

More silence. Then: "I'll need two assistant alchemists. Competent ones."

"Pick your team from the R&D pool. You have authorization to increase production staff by twenty percent."

"And if there's... regulatory interference?"

"Security is Asterion's domain. Your concern is production metrics. Hit your targets, collect your percentage. Guild politics are my problem, not yours."

Marcus nodded slowly. "When do I start?"

"Today. First production run needs to be ready in forty-eight hours."

> **[ARMI]**
> Personnel Assignment: Marcus Thiel (Alchemist, Level 8)
> Role: Apothecary Operations Lead
> Compensation: 150 GP/month + housing + 1% revenue share
> Production Capacity: 40 potions/day (solo), 120/day (with assistants)
> Status: ASSIGNED

"One more thing," Victor said. "You worked under Groll for eight years. You understand how Guild politics operate. I want weekly intelligence reports on Merchant Guild activity. Rumors, policy changes, personnel movements."

"You want me to spy."

"I want you to provide market intelligence as part of your operational oversight role. If that involves listening to gossip at the Tradesman's Guild Hall, consider it professional development."

Marcus's mouth twitched—not quite a smile, but close. "Understood."

"Dismissed."

After Marcus left, Victor updated the operational timeline. Marcus would select assistants by end of day. Production would begin tomorrow. Within forty-eight hours, the apothecary would have two thousand units of inventory.

Phase 1: Infrastructure. Complete.

Floor 1's training yard had been converted to what Sniv enthusiastically called the "Customer Service Academy"—a designation that horrified local adventurers and delighted absolutely no one except Sniv himself.

Victor observed from the upper balcony. Below, ten goblins sat in rows, clutching makeshift quills and attempting to copy phrases from a chalkboard.

Sniv stood at the front, wearing reading glasses Victor had never authorized and carrying a pointer stick he'd clearly stolen from somewhere.

"Repeat after Sniv!" the goblin announced. "Welcome to Insolvia Apothecary!"

The goblin chorus: "WELCOME TO BOSS'S HEALING JUICE PLACE!"

"No, no! *Insolvia.* In-SOL-via."

"IN-SKULL-VIA!"

"Close enough." Sniv turned to the chalkboard, scribbling frantically. "Module Two: No Eating Customers."

One goblin raised a clawed hand. "But what if customer very rude?"

"Still no eating!"

"What if customer attacks first?"

Sniv considered this. "Then... call security? Yes! Call big cow-man Asterion! He does the violence! You do the smiling!"

The goblins nodded solemnly, as if this were profound wisdom.

Victor descended the stairs. Sniv spotted him immediately and saluted.

"Boss! Training is proceeding with MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY!"

"Report," Victor said.

Sniv consulted his clipboard. "Ten recruits! All passed Module One: Basic Counting! Currently on Module Two: Customer Interaction Without Fatalities! Tomorrow: Module Three: Upselling Techniques!"

"Fatality rate during training?"

"Zero percent! New record!"

Victor examined the goblin students. They looked simultaneously terrified and determined—the ideal employee mindset.

"Graduation timeline?"

"Four days! Sniv guarantees customer service excellence! Or at least... customer service adequacy!"

"Revenue projection assumes six active shopkeepers for opening day. Can you deliver?"

"Sniv will deliver EIGHT shopkeepers! Plus two backup! Redundancy protocols! Sniv learned from Boss!"

Victor nodded. Sniv had evolved from illiterate scavenger to middle manager in eighteen months. The ROI on that initial recruitment decision remained incalculable.

"Module Three curriculum?" Victor asked.

Sniv flipped pages. "If customer buys one potion, suggest two potions! If customer buys health potion, suggest mana potion! Create value through product bundling!"

"You learned that phrase from the operations manual."

"Sniv reads ALL the manuals! Sniv is very dedicated employee!"

"Maintain current trajectory. Report any behavioral issues immediately."

"Understood!" Sniv turned back to his students. "Everyone! Practice smiling! Like this!" He demonstrated an expression that looked more like a threat than a welcome.

The goblins imitated him. It was horrifying.

Victor left them to it.

Below, Sniv's voice echoed: "Remember! Customer is always right! Unless customer is wrong! Then customer needs EDUCATION through pricing structure!"

The construction site sat at the dungeon's main entrance—a cleared pavilion where adventurers transitioned between city streets and dungeon passages. Asterion stood among partially built walls, reviewing architectural plans with one of his security contractors.

"Victor," the minotaur acknowledged.

"Security status."

"Twelve guards hired. Mix of dungeon veterans and ex-military. Three shifts, rotating coverage. Non-lethal protocols unless attacked with lethal intent."

Victor examined the perimeter. Stone walls, reinforced doors, anti-scrying wards embedded in the foundations. Professional work.

"Vulnerabilities?"

"Two. First: supply chain. If the Merchant Guild interferes with material deliveries, construction delays."

"Deliveries are sourced through the dungeon. Slime cores are internal production. No external touchpoints except the customer-facing storefront."

"Second vulnerability: legal harassment. Guild inspectors, bureaucratic pressure."

"The storefront is Crown Territory. City regulations don't apply. Guild charter authority ends at the dungeon boundary."

Asterion's ears flicked—bovine skepticism. "And if the Guild challenges that jurisdictionally?"

"Then we'll discover whether Lysander's political connections outweigh Prince Aldric's revenue share from our dungeon operations."

"You're betting on the Crown protecting its tax base."

"I'm betting on institutional self-interest. Aldric receives fifteen percent of dungeon revenue. Lysander receives nothing. When forced to choose, institutions protect their income streams."

Asterion nodded slowly. "What about the mystery mana signature you detected?"

Victor paused. He hadn't mentioned that to Asterion yet.

"You read the morning briefing reports," Victor said.

"I read everything that constitutes a security threat. Another Restructurer in Oakhaven qualifies."

"She's watching. I'm watching her. We're both waiting for the first move."

"And if she moves against you?"

"Then we'll find out if the Consortium trains us to compete or cooperate."

A notification pulsed in Victor's peripheral vision. ARMI's construction monitoring system.

> **[ARMI - CONSTRUCTION UPDATE]**
> Asset: Automated Slime Farm Alpha
> Status: 87% complete
> First harvest: 2 days
> Projected output: 2,000 cores/week (on target)
> Quality assessment: 98% Grade A+ specimens

Two days until harvest. One week until the storefront opened. Ten days until Lysander discovered what Victor had built.

"Timeline?" Asterion asked.

"Two days until we have product. One week until operations are ready. Two weeks until we open to the public."

"And then?"

"Then Lysander finds out what happens when someone tries to tax a Restructurer's revenue stream."

Asterion's expression didn't change—the minotaur had long since stopped being surprised by Victor's declarations—but his tail swished once. Anticipation, maybe. Or concern.

"I'll ensure security is ready," Asterion said.

"Do that."

Victor left the construction site and returned to the Core Chamber. Evening was approaching. Most of the dungeon's staff would be finishing daily operations. The slime farmers would be logging production metrics. Marcus would be selecting his assistant alchemists. Sniv would be putting his customer service trainees through Mock Transaction Scenario #4.

Everything proceeding according to plan.

Which made the ARMI notification that appeared ninety seconds later all the more disruptive.

> **[ARMI - PRIORITY MESSAGE]**
> Source: UNKNOWN RESTRUCTURER
> Encryption: Consortium Standard Protocol
> 
> **Message Received**:
> "To: Restructurer #REDACTED (Victor Kaine)
> From: Restructurer #418 (Designation: Liaison)
> 
> **Subject**: Territorial Introduction
> 
> You're not subtle. Neither am I.
> 
> Meet me at the Broken Barrel Inn, tomorrow, noon.
> Come alone. Bring your ARMI interface.
> 
> I'm not here to compete. I'm here to *evaluate*.
> 
> - Kira"

Victor stared at the message for seventeen seconds.

Analysis:
- She knew his Restructurer designation. Consortium-level intelligence access.
- She signed her name. Confidence or tactical transparency?
- Designation "Liaison" suggested oversight function, not operational. Evaluator, not competitor.
- She'd waited three days before initiating contact. Observation period complete.

Probability assessment:
- Trap: 23%
- Genuine Consortium oversight: 54%
- Recruitment attempt: 18%
- Unknown third option: 5%

He dismissed options 2 and 3 immediately. Refusing contact would signal weakness or paranoia. Sending a proxy would signal cowardice.

Decision: attend. Alone. Prepared for every scenario.

Victor composed his response via ARMI:

> "Accepted. Noon. Alone.
> Fair warning: I don't take orders well.
> - V.K."

He sent the message.

Tomorrow, he'd meet the Restructurer who'd been shadowing him for three days.

Tonight, he'd prepare for every possible outcome.

The Broken Barrel Inn. Noon. A public location—smart choice. Witnesses without surveillance. Professional approach.

Kira. Restructurer #418. Liaison designation.

Victor pulled up Consortium protocol classifications. "Liaison" meant inter-agent coordination. Oversight function. Evaluation authority.

And, notably, termination authority if necessary.

> **[ARMI - QUEST UPDATE]**
> Quest: [Market Intelligence]
> Status: PROGRESSING
> New Objective: Survive meeting with Restructurer #418
> Reward: Intelligence on Consortium operations
> Risk Level: MODERATE-HIGH
> 
> **Advisory**: Liaison-class agents have discretionary oversight authority.
> **Recommendation**: Demonstrate competence. Avoid antagonism.

Victor dismissed the notification.

Demonstrate competence. That part was easy.

Avoid antagonism? Significantly harder.

He pulled up tomorrow's schedule. Apothecary construction. Marcus's production planning. Sniv's training graduation. And now: a meeting with a Consortium evaluator who had the authority to classify him as a problematic asset.

A normal day for a Regional Operator.

Victor closed the reports. Dimmed the Core Chamber lights. Left through the administrative corridors.

Somewhere in Oakhaven, Kira was preparing her evaluation criteria.

Victor would ensure those criteria highlighted his value, not his liabilities.

One meeting. One Restructurer. One opportunity to determine whether the Consortium viewed him as an asset or a threat.

He had sixteen hours to prepare.

Sixteen hours to ensure that when Kira evaluated Victor Kaine, she saw the operator who'd reached 1.022 million GP in twenty-three days.

Not the liability who'd executed seven illegal arbitrage transactions to meet that goal.

The difference, Victor suspected, would determine whether tomorrow's meeting ended with a handshake or a termination notice.

Either way, he'd find out at noon.

The Broken Barrel Inn. Tomorrow.

Victor Kaine's calendar was never boring.
