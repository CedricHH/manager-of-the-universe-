# Chapter 94: The Convergence

Victor's office had never been this crowded.

Three people. Three crises. All demanding immediate resolution.

Paladin Roland stood by the door—nervous, armed, technically here as "Church liaison" but actually Nova's compliance monitor since Chapter 62.

Voros Thane sat across the desk—Merchant Guild representative, newly minted logistics partner.

And on the Exchange hologram: Hestia's avatar. Glowing. Impatient.

"Gentlemen," Victor said. "You all arrived within ten minutes of each other. That's statistically improbable. So either you're coordinating, or someone leaked my schedule."

Roland shifted uncomfortably. "I came because High Priestess Aurelia sent updated instructions—"

"I came because the Coalition doubled their order," Voros interrupted.

Hestia's avatar smiled. "I came because your shell company activity triggered *another* algorithmic flag. This one can't be paid off."

Victor leaned back. "Let's triage. Worst threat first."

He looked at Hestia. "What flag?"

"Transaction velocity," Hestia said. "You just purchased ten miracles across ten different accounts within forty minutes. G.A.C. anti-fraud algorithms see that as distributed money laundering. They've dispatched a manual auditor. ETA: Sixty-eight hours."

> **[ARMI - Threat Assessment]**
> **G.A.C. Manual Audit:** Cannot be avoided via payment
> **Timeline:** 68 hours
> **Consequence (if failed):** Account freeze + Consortium contract termination

"How do I pass the audit?" Victor asked.

"Prove the transactions are legitimate business activity, not criminal enterprise. Show buyer contracts, logistical records, and lawful intent."

"I have all of that."

"You have them for **illegal miracle arbitrage undermining a planetary Church**," Hestia said flatly. "The Consortium's official stance is neutrality in local religious politics. If the auditor determines you're destabilizing Terra-Insolvia's power structures for profit, they'll classify you as 'systematic interference.' That's grounds for termination."

Victor's jaw tightened. "So I'm supposed to let the Church monopolize miracles?"

"You're supposed to stay under the radar."

"Too late for that."

Hestia sighed. "Then you need a legal defense. Prove you're operating within local law. Get documentation—Imperial charters, Merchant Guild endorsements, **Noble House contracts**. Make it look legitimate."

Victor glanced at Voros. "How fast can the Guild produce those contracts?"

"Forty-eight hours," Voros said. "But there's a problem. The Coalition just sent updated orders."

He slid a document across the desk.

> **SOUTHERN COALITION - EMERGENCY EXPANSION**
> **Previous Order:** 2 estates, 10 miracles, 180,000 GP
> **Revised Order:** 12 estates, 60 miracles, 540,000 GP
> **Reason:** Church raids accelerated. Three estates lost grain reserves. Rebellion timeline collapsed to 72 hours.
>**Payment Terms:** 50% advance (270,000 GP), 50% on delivery

Victor read it twice.

Sixty miracles.

In seventy-two hours.

"That's impossible," he said.

"It's survival," Voros countered. "If the Coalition doesn't get miracles before Church confiscates more food, the peasants riot. If peasants riot, governors call in the army. If the army arrives, the Coalition loses."

Victor did the math.

**Current Buying Capacity (per week):**
- Main Account (Tier 1): 100,000 GP
- 10 Shell Companies: 250,000 GP
- **Total:** 350,000 GP

**Cost for 60 Miracles:**
- 60 × 40,000 GP average = 2,400,000 GP

Victor couldn't afford that in a year, let alone seventy-two hours.

"Voros. This is outside my capacity."

"Then scale faster."

"How? I'm already running ten shells at max limit."

Voros leaned forward. "Partner with other Exchange vendors. You can't buy sixty miracles—but you could broker them. Take orders, source from multiple suppliers, collect commission."

Victor paused.

That... could work.

"Commission rate?"

"Fifteen percent. You're the middleman. Suppliers deliver. You take the spread."

Victor opened a new calculation.

**Brokerage Model:**
- Coalition pays: 540,000 GP
- Supplier costs: ~470,000 GP (wholesale rates)
- Victor's commission: 70,000 GP (15%)
- Guild logistics fee: -54,000 GP (20% of gross)
- **Net Profit:** 16,000 GP

Lower margin than direct sales. But achievable within seventy-two hours.

"Fine," Victor said. "I'll broker. But I need Guild transport guarantees. If one delivery fails, the whole Coalition contract collapses."

"Done."

They shook hands.

> **[ARMI - Coalition Contract Updated]**
> **Model:** Brokerage (15% commission)
> **Timeline:**  72 hours
> **Estimated Revenue:** 70,000 GP
> **Risk Level:** HIGH (Church interception probability: 45%)

Roland cleared his throat.

"Victor. About the Church—"

"I know," Victor interrupted. "Aurelia wants to meet. Sunspire Cathedral. Five days."

"She moved the timeline," Roland said quietly. "You're summoned in **three days**. And she's sending Inquisitor-General Matthias."

The room went silent.

"Who's Matthias?" Voros asked.

"The man who burned fourteen merchants in Westmarch for selling 'unauthorized relics,'" Roland said. "They had legal acquisition documents. He burned them anyway."

> **[ARMI - Threat Profile]**
> **Inquisitor-General Matthias**
> **Level:** 28  
> **Class:** Divine Executioner
> **Jurisdiction:** Overrides Imperial, Guild, and Noble law
> **Combat Win Probability:** 2%
> **Negotiation Win Probability:** UNKNOWN

Victor stared at the profile.

Level 28.

That was higher than anyone he'd faced. Higher than Theron. Higher than the adventurers who'd challenged his dungeon.

Matthias was Church endgame.

"Why send him?" Victor asked.

"Because Aurelia thinks you're a systemic threat," Roland said. "Three estates received miracles this week. Church rain blessings failed on four others. The southern provinces are switching loyalty from Church to... whoever you are. Aurelia sees that as heresy **and** political rebellion."

"I'm not rebelling. I'm selling."

"You're undermining divine authority," Roland said. "To the Church, that's the same thing."

Victor tapped his pen.

Three converging deadlines:

1. **G.A.C. Audit:** 68 hours (requires legal documentation)
2. **Coalition Delivery:** 72 hours (requires 60 miracles brokered)
3. **Church Summons:** 72 hours (requires... what? Surrender? Negotiation? Fireproof armor?)

He couldn't fight Matthias. Couldn't run (Church had Imperial jurisdiction). Couldn't ignore the summons (auto-conviction for heresy).

That left one option.

"Roland. Tell Aurelia I'll attend. But not at Sunspire Cathedral."

"She won't accept alternate locations—"

"She will," Victor said. "Because I'll offer something she needs: **the reason Church miracles are failing**."

Roland froze. "You... know?"

"I have a hypothesis." Victor pulled up Exchange data—divine artifact transaction histories across twelve worlds. "Church miracle production is declining. Success rates dropped from ninety percent to sixty-five percent. That suggests either:"

He counted on his fingers.

"One: The gods are reducing supply."

"Two: Church mana conduits are degrading."

"Or three: Demand is outpacing divine capacity."

"How would you know that?" Roland asked.

"Because I've seen the same pattern on other worlds," Victor said. "The Galactic Exchange tracks divine economies across forty-seven planets. Thirty-two show declining Church production over the last decade. It's systemic."

Voros whistled. "You're saying the gods are... running out?"

"I'm saying divine energy is a finite resource," Victor corrected. "And Churches have been over-harvesting. Like depleting a mine."

Roland's face went pale. "If Aurelia hears this—"

"She already suspects," Victor said. "That's why she's desperate to control alternative miracle sources. The Church knows it's failing. They just don't know **why**."

He stood.

"Roland. Tell Aurelia: I'll meet her in neutral territory. Public location. Imperial witness. And I'll explain the divine market collapse—in exchange for non-aggression."

Roland hesitated. Then nodded. "I'll relay your message."

***

After Roland left, Voros leaned back. "You're playing a dangerous game, Victor. Telling the Church their gods are failing?"

"I'm trading information for time," Victor said. "If Aurelia wants answers, she'll delay Matthias. That gives me seventy-two hours to execute Coalition delivery."

"And the G.A.C. audit?"

Victor opened his Exchange interface. Started drafting formal contracts. Coalition purchase orders. Guild logistics agreements. Noble House endorsements (forged—but professionally).

"I'll have documentation ready in forty-eight hours," Victor said. "Legal, organized, and boring enough that an auditor will approve it without looking twice."

Voros smiled. "You've done this before."

"Corporate compliance audits," Victor said. "Same principle. Bury them in paperwork. Make it too expensive to dig deeper."

He sent the Coalition broker request to twelve Exchange vendors.

Responses came within minutes.

Nine accepted.

Total supply: Sixty-two miracles.

Delivery timeline: Seventy-two hours.

> **[ARMI - Coalition Delivery]**
> **Status:** BROKERAGE CONFIRMED
> **Suppliers:** 9 vendors (Worlds 12-A, 8-F, 22-D, etc.)
> **Total Cost:** 468,000 GP (wholesale)
> **Coalition Payment:** 540,000 GP
> **Victor's Commission:** 72,000 GP
> **Guild Fees:** -54,000 GP
> **Net Profit:** 18,000 GP

Voros checked the logistics chain. "Guild caravans depart in six hours. Dimensional transfers start at dawn. This might actually work."

"It has to," Victor said.

A new message appeared.

From Lady Cassia.

> Victor,
>
> Church just arrested Lord Harkin Vale. Charged with heresy for "receiving unblessed rain." His estate is under siege.
>
> If miracles don't arrive by tomorrow sunrise, Coalition votes to surrender.
>
> Please.
>
> -C

Victor stared at the message.

Lord Harkin Vale. One of the fourteen Coalition estates.

The Church was escalating.

> **[ARMI - Strategic Analysis]**
> **Church Strategy:** Arrest Coalition leaders before miracles arrive
> **Coalition Response:** Panic, potential fracture
> **Victor's Position:** Critical supply chain = political kingmaker

He wasn't just selling miracles anymore.

He was deciding whether a rebellion lived or died.

Victor closed the message.

Looked at Voros.

"Move the delivery timeline up. I want first miracles delivered in twelve hours."

"That's impossible—"

"Offer double fees to suppliers. Instant Transfer premiums. Whatever it takes."

Voros hesitated. Then nodded. "I'll make it happen."

Victor turned to Hestia's avatar. "And the audit?"

"Prepare your documentation," Hestia said. "And pray the auditor is lazy."

She disconnected.

Victor sat alone in his office.

Three crises. Seventy-two hours.

> **[ARMI - Threat Convergence Summary]**
> **G.A.C. Audit:** 68 hours (documentation defense prepared)
> **Coalition Delivery:** Accelerated to 12 hours (premium fees applied)
> **Church Summons:** 72 hours (negotiation strategy: divine market intel)
> **Consortium Deadline:** 27 days, 851,970 GP remaining
> **Survival Probability:** 34%

Victor cracked his knuckles.

Opened the Exchange.

And started brokering miracles.
