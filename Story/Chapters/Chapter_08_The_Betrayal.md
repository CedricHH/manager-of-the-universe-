# Chapter 8: The Betrayal

Sniv was learning to count.

Victor watched from his throne as the small goblin moved through the new arrivals, scratching tally marks on his clipboard. Labor-13. Labor-14. Guard-5. Each number assigned with the solemn gravity of a priest conducting baptisms.

The defeated goblins accepted their designations without complaint. They had seen what Victor did to their Alpha. They had watched his face melt.

Numbers were preferable to death.

"Boss."

Victor looked up. Sniv had finished his processing and now stood before the throne, clipboard clutched to his chest.

"New gobs scared but follow," Sniv reported. "They see Boss burn Alpha. They loyal now."

*Loyal.*

The word hung in the air between them.

"Loyal because they're afraid," Victor corrected. "Fear and loyalty aren't the same thing."

Sniv tilted his head, considering this distinction. Then he shook it off.

"Sniv not scared of Boss." The small goblin's yellow eyes were earnest. Sincere. "Sniv *trust*."

Trust.

The word cut deeper than any weapon in their primitive arsenal.

Victor closed his eyes.

*Three years ago. Another life.*

The boardroom of Kaine Industries occupied the entire 47th floor of a Manhattan skyscraper. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a panoramic view of the city—a reminder to everyone present that they stood at the apex of American commerce. The afternoon sun caught the crystal decanters on the sideboard, throwing rainbows across Italian marble.

Everything in this room cost money. The Eames chairs. The Nakashima table. The abstract art on the walls—purchased at auction for seven figures, though no one in the room cared about aesthetics.

This room was designed to intimidate. And for fifteen years, Victor had been the one doing the intimidating.

Today, the twelve board members wouldn't meet his eyes.

"Victor." Chairman Morrison spoke first. Old money. Old power. Old enough to remember when deals were sealed with handshakes instead of lawyers. His suit cost more than most people's annual salary. His empathy cost considerably less. "We need to discuss the SEC investigation."

"The investigation into conflict minerals," Victor said evenly. "Which I flagged as a potential liability eighteen months ago. I believe my memo is in the record."

Morrison nodded, as if this were a reasonable point in a reasonable discussion. It wasn't. Victor could read the room—he had built his career on reading rooms—and this one had already decided his fate.

"Your division signed the procurement contracts."

"My division executed procurement policies approved by this board." Victor tapped the stack of documents in front of him. Each one bore signatures from multiple executives, legal reviews, compliance stamps. "Every contract has three signatures minimum. Every policy went through legal review. If there's liability here, it's collective."

The board members shifted uncomfortably. Karen Whitfield—head of legal, usually his ally—studied her manicure with sudden fascination. Thomas Chen—no relation to Elena—cleared his throat and said nothing.

James Wheeler—CFO, third-generation Harvard, chronic yacht enthusiast—decided to be the executioner's assistant. "Victor, the evidence trail is... specific. Your name appears on the most damaging documents."

"Because I do my job." Victor's voice remained calm. Fifteen years of practice at controlling his reactions in moments of crisis. "I sign everything that crosses my desk because that's what executives do. The question isn't whose signature appears—it's who approved the policies that required those signatures."

He looked at Morrison. At Wheeler. At Whitfield.

"Every person in this room saw those supply chain reports. Every person approved the cost savings. Every person chose not to ask where the savings came from."

Silence. Heavy. Damning. No one disputed him because no one could.

Chairman Morrison folded his hands. The gesture was almost paternal. It made Victor want to break something.

"Victor, the company needs a face for this scandal."

The words landed like stones in still water.

"Excuse me?"

"You've served well. Fifteen years of excellent work. No one disputes that." Morrison's voice was reasonable. Kind, even. The voice of a man ordering an execution while offering the condemned a last meal. "But the SEC wants blood. The shareholders want blood. The media has been circling for weeks. And if we don't give them a target, they'll destroy the entire company."

Victor looked around the table. Twelve faces. Twelve people he had worked with for over a decade. Twelve people who were, at this moment, calculating his worth versus their survival.

Karen—who had gotten drunk with him at conferences.
Thomas—whose promotion Victor had advocated for.
James—who had cried on Victor's shoulder during his divorce.

The math was clearly not in his favor.

"You're sacrificing me."

Morrison shrugged—a small, economical gesture that conveyed precisely zero guilt. A lifetime of privilege had insulated him from consequences. This decision would cost him nothing except perhaps a moment of mild discomfort.

"It's just business."

The door opened.

Elena Chen entered. Thirty-two years old. Sharp. Ambitious. Victor had recruited her personally from Wharton, had mentored her through her first five years in the industry. He had taught her everything—negotiations, restructuring, the art of reading a room and finding the weakness.

She had learned well.

She carried a manila folder.

"I'm sorry, Victor." Her voice was steady. Professional. The voice of someone who had already made peace with what she was doing. "But if the company falls, ten thousand people lose their jobs. Families. Mortgages. College funds. Children who need braces and parents who need medicine."

She placed the folder on the table in front of him.

"One man for ten thousand. The math is simple."

*The math is simple.*

Victor stared at the folder. Inside, he knew, was a confession. Pre-written. Pre-approved. Probably drafted months ago, the moment they realized someone would need to take the fall.

"You taught me that math," Elena continued. Her eyes were steady on his. No tears. No hesitation. "Utilitarian calculus. Maximum benefit for minimum cost. You literally gave me the textbook, Victor."

She was right. He had. He had created the weapon that was now pointed at his heart.

"Sign the confession," Morrison said. "We'll provide a golden parachute. Two years' salary, full benefits, a glowing recommendation for your next position. You'll land on your feet. You always do."

Victor looked at Elena. His student. His protégé.

His betrayer.

"Did they offer you my job?"

A flicker crossed her face—the first crack in her composure. But she recovered quickly.

"Someone has to hold things together after you're gone."

That was a yes.

Victor picked up the pen. It was a Montblanc—the same model he'd given Elena as a graduation gift. The irony wasn't lost on him.

He signed.

His name, rendered in black ink, ending fifteen years of work. His signature—the same signature that had sealed billion-dollar deals, that had authorized layoffs and acquisitions and restructurings—now authorizing his own destruction.

"Pleasure doing business," Morrison said, reaching for the folder.

Victor held onto it for one moment longer.

"Remember this," he said, looking at each of them in turn. "Remember what loyalty costs in this room. Because someday, you'll be sitting where I am. And there won't be anyone left to sacrifice."

He released the folder and walked out.

No one said goodbye.

Victor opened his eyes.

The boardroom was gone. The glass walls, the Manhattan skyline, the faces of eleven people who had chosen their careers over his—all of it dissolved into darkness and stone.

Sniv stood before him, eyes wide with concern.

"Boss? Boss eyes went far away."

Victor looked at his hands. Different now. Not the manicured hands of an executive, but the callused hands of a survivor. Scratched by goblin claws. Stained with slime residue.

The hollow feeling, though—that was exactly the same.

"How long was I gone?"

"Many heartbeats. Sniv count: one-two-many-many-many."

Minutes, then. A momentary lapse.

Victor stood, shaking off the memory like a weight. The past was the past. Elena was a world away. Morrison was probably dead of old age by now—natural causes or shareholder revolt, it didn't matter which.

This was his reality now. Goblins. Dungeons. Survival.

Different arena. Same rules.

"Sniv. New policy."

The goblin straightened, clipboard ready.

"Loyalty is rewarded. The original fourteen—your group—get double rations starting tonight. They followed me when they had nothing. That gets recognized."

Sniv's eyes widened. "Double food? For old gobs?"

"For veterans. They've earned it."

The small goblin practically vibrated with pride. *His* group. *His* people. Elevated above the newcomers.

"And disloyalty?" Sniv asked, already knowing part of the answer.

"Punished. Immediately. No warnings. No second chances."

Victor thought of Elena. Her steady voice. Her simple math.

*One man for ten thousand.*

"Anyone who betrays this operation—" he let the words hang in the dark air "—gets the same treatment as the Alpha."

Sniv nodded gravely.

"Boss is fair. Boss is strong."

Victor didn't feel fair. He felt like something that had been broken once and refused to break the same way twice.

But if that's what leadership looked like in this world, he could work with it.
