# Chapter 48: The Whale

Sir Gareth's coin purse hit the desk like a surrender.

Ten gold coins spilled across Valerius's immaculate ledger. They gleamed in the afternoon sun—each one worth more than a goblin saw in a lifetime. More than most adventurers earned in a month. And Gareth had just dropped them at the feet of a man in a suit.

Victor counted them. Slowly. Deliberately. Making sure every set of noble eyes tracked each coin as he stacked them.

He'd learned this technique in a boardroom in Singapore—the power of silence, the weight of anticipation. Every second of counting was a second where Gareth wasn't in control. Every clink of gold on gold was a reminder of who had authority here.

"Nine... ten." He looked up. "Exact change. How refreshing."

Gareth's jaw worked beneath his perfectly groomed beard. Humiliation radiated off him like heat from a forge. His companions—five knights in matching gold-trimmed armor—shifted uncomfortably on their horses, uncertain whether to draw steel or avert their gaze.

"You will regret this," Gareth hissed.

Victor smiled. It was the smile of a man who had been threatened by better men with sharper swords.

"For your inconvenience," Victor said, pocketing the coins, "I'm upgrading you to the Platinum Package. Complimentary."

Gareth blinked. The other knights exchanged confused glances. One of them mouthed the word "complimentary" like it was a foreign language.

"The... what?" Gareth managed.

"Platinum Package," Victor repeated, gesturing toward the cave entrance. "Personal guide. Priority access to Floor 3. VIP loot table. The experience typically reserved for our most distinguished patrons."

He extended a hand toward the dungeon mouth.

"Welcome to Insolvia, Sir Gareth. Your adventure awaits."

Valerius practically vibrated with panic once the Sterling party disappeared into the darkness.

"Do you have any idea what you've done?" The former Guild appraiser's voice cracked. "That's Lord Reginald Sterling's nephew. *The* Lord Sterling. The one who controls half the trade routes in Eastmarch!"

Victor was watching the cave entrance, calculating. "I'm aware."

"He has private armies! He has connections to the Crown! He has—"

"A nephew with something to prove." Victor turned to face Valerius. "Tell me: Why does the heir to Eastmarch's most powerful house come to a Tutorial Dungeon with five bodyguards? Why not a dragon's lair? A demon fortress? Something *impressive*?"

Valerius opened his mouth. Closed it. Then understanding dawned across his features, slow and horrified.

"He's not here for glory," Victor continued. "Lord Sterling sent him. The real Lord Sterling—the one I already have a partnership with. Twenty percent of my gross revenue flows to Eastmarch every quarter. So why send the nephew?"

"A test," Valerius whispered. "He's testing you."

"Or evaluating his investment." Victor clasped his hands behind his back. "Either way, the nephew is a messenger. And messengers are opportunities."

Victor's eyes narrowed. "The Core. Sterling knows about Nova. He wants to know if she's worth more than a footnote in his ledgers."

Valerius went pale. "How could he possibly—"

"The same way you knew this dungeon was different." Victor's voice was cold. "Someone talked. The Guild rumors. The adventurers who returned with stories instead of loot. Word travels. And Lord Sterling didn't become the economic heart of Eastmarch by ignoring word."

The former appraiser swallowed hard. "What do we do?"

Victor was already walking toward the cave, his suit jacket catching the afternoon light. "We give him exactly what he came for. The full tour. And by the time he leaves, he'll be carrying an offer his uncle can't refuse."

Sniv was having the time of his life.

"Very important clients!" the goblin chirped, scuttling ahead of the Sterling party through the torchlit corridor. His tie—the silk handkerchief Victor had gifted him—flapped with every step. "Platinum Package customers get *best* service! Best traps! Best monsters!"

"Get that creature away from me," Gareth snarled, his enchanted sword drawn, eyes scanning every shadow. "If it touches me, I'll—"

"Sir Gareth!" Sniv interrupted, pointing at the ceiling with genuine enthusiasm. "That is Dart Trap Seven! Very precise! Only activates if wrong password spoken! Password is—"

"STOP TALKING!"

Sniv's grin didn't falter. "Password is 'please'. Very tricky, yes?"

Behind Gareth, one of his knights—a woman with a scar across her cheek—snorted. Her superior's glare could have melted steel.

The party had been in the dungeon for forty minutes. In that time, they had encountered:

- One "complimentary" combat encounter (three goblins who surrendered immediately and offered to sell them healing potions).
- Two "premium trap experiences" (a pit that turned out to be ankle-deep, and a boulder that rolled three feet and stopped).
- Seventeen "promotional announcements" from Sniv about the Season Pass and Loyalty Rewards Program.

They were professionals. Level 15, minimum. The dungeon's standard threats were insults to their capabilities.

But they weren't here for easy kills.

"Where is the Core?" Gareth demanded, grabbing Sniv by the tie. The goblin dangled, feet kicking. "I know there's a Core here. Take me to it."

Sniv's eyes went wide. Not with fear—with corporate offense.

"Sir tries to access Floor 3 without Floor 3 upgrade?" Sniv gasped. "Floor 3 is *premium content*! Must sign additional waiver! Must pay supplementary fee!"

"I ALREADY PAID—"

"That was *entry* fee," Sniv corrected primly. "Floor 1 and 2 only. Floor 3 is where *executive* meetings happen. Very exclusive. Very expensive."

Gareth's sword pressed against Sniv's throat.

The goblin smiled. It was a smile he'd learned from Victor.

"Kill Sniv, no problem. But..." He pointed behind Gareth. "No ticket, no entry. Terms of Service."

Gareth turned.

Asterion stood at the corridor junction. He hadn't been there a moment ago. He was simply *present*—ten feet of muscle and horn, greataxe resting on his shoulder like a cane, his SECURITY sash almost comically small across his massive chest.

The torchlight flickered across the minotaur's scarred hide. Two hundred and forty-seven years of combat experience looked down at six overconfident nobles with the enthusiasm of a DMV clerk facing a line of complainers.

"Ticket check," Asterion rumbled.

The Sterling knights drew steel. Six enchanted blades against one minotaur. The woman with the scar—the smart one—took a step back instead of forward. She'd seen something the others hadn't: Asterion wasn't tensing. He wasn't preparing to fight.

He was waiting for them to try something stupid.

"Stand down," Gareth ordered, though his voice wavered. "This is... obviously a negotiation tactic."

Asterion yawned. It was a slow, deliberate yawn, displaying teeth that could crush armor.

"Floor 3 access," the minotaur said, "is five gold. Premium escort included."

Gareth threw the coins at Asterion's feet. The minotaur nodded and stepped aside, revealing a stairway descending into deeper blue light.

"The Manager is expecting you."

Victor was already in the Core Chamber when they arrived.

He sat at a stone table—a recent addition, carved from dungeon rock by industrious goblins. A tea set rested before him. Steam rose from a ceramic pot that looked absurdly civilized against the crystalline glow of Nova pulsing in the center of the room.

"Sir Gareth." Victor gestured to the empty chairs. "I've been expecting you. Please. Sit."

Gareth stood in the doorway, breathing hard. His perfect hair was disheveled. His perfect armor was scratched (Sniv's "complimentary" goblins had been less compliant on Floor 2). His perfect pride was in tatters.

"You..." Gareth's voice shook. "You've been manipulating me. This whole time."

"Correct." Victor poured tea. "Sugar?"

"I'm going to kill you."

"You're going to sit down." Victor didn't look up. "Because you were sent here by your uncle. And if you return empty-handed—having paid ten gold for the privilege of being humiliated by goblins—Lord Sterling will reassign you to something even more embarrassing. Northern border patrol, perhaps. Counting sheep."

Gareth didn't move.

Victor sipped his tea.

"Alternatively," Victor continued, "you sit. You listen. You return to your uncle with something valuable: information. A business proposal. Suddenly, you're not the nephew who got tricked by a commoner. You're the *envoy* who established first contact with a new asset."

The silence stretched.

Nova pulsed, soft and blue, observing without comment.

> **[ARMI]**  
> Negotiation Mode: Active.

Slowly, painfully, Sir Gareth of House Sterling pulled out a chair.

He sat.

"Talk," Gareth said through gritted teeth. "But know this—whatever you're selling, my uncle will dismember you for even suggesting it."

Victor smiled. It was the smile of a man who had closed harder deals in worse rooms with more dangerous clients. He had negotiated with Yakuza subsidiaries in Tokyo. He had restructured cartels in South America while men with guns stood behind his chair. One arrogant noble with a bruised ego was not going to rattle him.

"Sir Gareth," he said, "I'm not selling your uncle anything. I'm offering him a partnership. Insolvia Holdings controls the most profitable dungeon in this region. Your uncle controls the trade routes. We already have a twenty percent arrangement—but that was for basic operations."

He slid a piece of parchment across the table. The numbers on it were... significant.

"Together, we could own the entire adventurer economy of Eastmarch. Training facilities. Equipment certification. Exclusive dungeon access for premium clients. Loot appraisal services with guaranteed buy-back. A vertical monopoly from the equipment shop to the tombstone."

He leaned forward.

"The question isn't whether Lord Sterling will dismember me. The question is: what percentage of a ten-thousand gold annual revenue stream will he accept in exchange for legitimacy?"

Gareth's eyes widened. That number was larger than his family's estate produced in a year.

Behind Victor, Nova pulsed—a deep, interested blue.
