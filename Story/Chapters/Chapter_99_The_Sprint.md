# Chapter 99: The Sprint

Ten days later.

Victor reviewed the transaction log.

Ahead of pace.

But there was a problem.

Trade #10—the last Phoenix Tears potion—had taken seventy-two hours to sell. Previous trades? Eighteen to twenty-four hours maximum.

The market was **saturating**.

***

Nova's light pulsed. "Victor. Phoenix Tears sale finally cleared. But I'm detecting price softness. Buyers are questioning supply surge."

Victor pulled up Terra-Insolvia's secondary marketplace.

**Phoenix Tears - Historical Data:**
- Average monthly sales: 8 units
- Victor's sales (10 days): 5 units  
- Market penetration: 62.5% of monthly volume in 33% of time

**Mythril Plate - Historical Data:**
- Average monthly sales: 3 units
- Victor's sales: 2 units
- Market penetration: 66.7% of monthly volume

"I'm flooding niche markets," Victor said.

"Exactly," Nova confirmed. "Economic principle: supply surge creates price pressure. If you continue at this rate, margins collapse. Your remaining thirteen trades become worthless."

Voros's voice crackled through the communication crystal. "Victor, Merchant Guild contacts are asking questions. 'Where is Kaine sourcing this volume?' 'Is the quality authentic?' You're creating disruption."

"That's the point."

"Or suspicion," Voros countered. "If buyers think you're dumping counterfeits or stolen goods, prices tank. You destroy the market you're selling into."

> **[ARMI - Market Strategy Analysis]**
> **Option A:** Slow trade pace (preserve margins, avoid saturation)
> **Option B:** Diversify items (spread across more markets)
> **Option C:** Scale up (bulk sales to Guild distributors)

Victor chose B.

"Change strategy," he said. "No more concentrated trades. Diversify across categories. Two Phoenix Tears maximum per market. Spread the volume."

He queued new purchases:

**Trade #11:** [Enchanted Longsword - Flamebrand]  
**Trade #12:** [Spell Scroll - Mass Teleport]  
**Trade #13:** [Alchemical Reagent - Void Dust (bulk)]

Different markets. Different buyer demographics. Lower per-category impact.

***

**Days 11-12**

The diversified trades executed smoothly.

> **[Trades #11-13]**
> - Flamebrand: 18k GP → 52k GP (**34k profit**)
> - Mass Teleport Scroll: 22k GP → 68k GP (**46k profit**)
> - Void Dust: 15k GP → 41k GP (**26k profit**)
>
> **Total New Profit:** 106,000 GP  
> **Running Total:** 454,000 GP  
> **Status:** Halfway to goal | On pace

Asterion watched the numbers climb. "It's working. Market absorption is stable."

"For now," Victor said.

***

**Day 13**

Executor Veyra appeared in the Core Chamber.

Unannounced.

"Executor," Victor said. "I wasn't expecting you."

"Probation includes unscheduled audits," Veyra said. Her ice-blue eyes scanned the transaction logs floating mid-air. "I'm exercising that clause."

She pulled up Victor's full history.

"Twenty-three trades planned. Thirteen executed. Profit: four hundred fifty-four thousand gold pieces in thirteen days."

"Is that a problem?"

"It's... unusual." Veyra zoomed to specific items. "Dimensional Anchor crystals. Phoenix Tears. Void Dust. Where are you sourcing them?"

"Galactic Exchange. Vetted vendors. Standard protocols."

"Standard protocols don't explain this volume. You're moving merchandise faster than established traders with decades of infrastructure." She turned to him. "That attracts attention."

Victor understood immediately.

Veyra wasn't concerned about policy compliance. She was concerned about **visibility**.

"The Consortium values discretion, Restructurer Kaine," Veyra said. "Your arbitrage is compliant. But if it draws regulatory scrutiny from Terra-Insolvia's Imperial Customs or Merchant Oversight Bureau, you become a **liability**. And liabilities get... liquidated."

"What do you recommend?" Victor asked.

"Slow down. Or obscure your source chain."

Victor met her gaze. "Slowing down means missing the thirty-day deadline. The Consortium wouldn't approve that. Obscuring sources means operating through proxies—which creates new dependency relationships. The very thing you're monitoring me for."

Veyra said nothing.

Because Victor was **right**.

She couldn't tell him to slow down (Consortium wanted the million gold). She couldn't tell him to use proxies (probation forbade new partnerships).

She was stuck.

"Operate as you see fit," Veyra said finally. "But understand: if Terra-Insolvia's authorities flag your operation, the Consortium won't protect you. You'll be on your own."

"Understood."

Veyra left.

***

After she was gone, Hestia's avatar shimmered into view.

"She's right, Victor. Imperial Customs opened an inquiry. 'Anomalous trade volume from unregistered merchant.' That's you."

Nova dimmed. "What happens if Customs finds the Galactic Exchange connection?"

"They can't," Victor said. "Exchange transactions are dimensional. Customs can see items appearing via Waypoint, but they can't trace interdimensional origins without archmage-level divination. And divination costs more than the investigation is worth."

"Unless they decide you're a strategic threat," Asterion said.

Victor pulled up the remaining timeline.

**Remaining Trades:** 10  
**Remaining Days:** 12  
**Required Profit:** 397,000 GP (851k goal - 454k current)  
**Average Per Trade:** 39,700 GP

If Customs seized goods mid-transit, everything collapsed.

**Solution:** Front-load trades. Execute FASTER before Customs escalated.

"Accelerate the schedule," Victor said. "Six trades in the next seventy-two hours. High-margin, fast turnover. Then four medium-margin trades with lower visibility."

"That's aggressive," Voros said.

"Aggressive beats seized," Victor countered.

***

**Days 14-16** (48 hours - 6 trades):

Victor operated like a machine.

Purchase. Transfer. List. Sell. Repeat.

> **[Trade #14]:** Skill Crystal - Battle Meditation | 12k → 38k (**26k profit**)  
> **[Trade #15]:** Potion - Greater Mana | 8k → 29k (**21k profit**)  
> **[Trade #16]:** Enchanted Shield - Aegis Ward | 25k → 71k (**46k profit**)  
> **[Trade #17]:** Spell Component - Dragon Scale | 14k → 45k (**31k profit**)  
> **[Trade #18]:** Artifact Fragment - Time Shard | 30k → 95k (**65k profit**)  
> **[Trade #19]:** Rare Herb - Moonpetal (bulk) | 11k → 37k (**26k profit**)

**Total:** 215,000 GP profit

**Running Total:** 669,000 GP

Sniv stared at the numbers. "Boss makes money so fast! Like... like Boss is printing gold!"

"I'm arbitraging inefficiencies," Victor said. "Different thing."

"Sniv doesn't know difference."

"Neither do most people. That's why it works."

***

**Day 17**

A summons arrived.

> **Imperial Customs Bureau**  
> **Subject:** Trade Volume Inquiry  
> **Summons:** Victor Kaine to appear for questioning regarding "unregistered merchant activity exceeding statutory thresholds."  
> **Date:** Three days hence (Day 20)

Victor read it twice.

Then filed it under "problems for later."

He had four trades left. Nine days remaining.

Customs could wait.

***

**Days 18-20** (Final 4 trades):

> **[Trade #20]:** Enchanted Cloak - Shadowmeld | 16k → 48k (**32k profit**)  
> **[Trade #21]:** Potion Set - Elemental Resistance | 20k → 64k (**44k profit**)  
> **[Trade #22]:** Skill Book - Advanced Swordsmanship | 18k → 61k (**43k profit**)  
> **[Trade #23]:** Magical Gemstone - Astral Ruby | 27k → 88k (**61k profit**)

**Total:** 180,000 GP

**FINAL ARBITRAGE TOTAL:** 849,000 GP profit

Plus existing revenue streams (Church brokerage, dungeon operations): 38,000 GP

**Grand Total:** 887,000 GP

Victor stared at the number.

> **[ARMI - Consortium Progress]**
> **Current Balance:** 887,000 GP  
> **Goal:** 1,000,000 GP  
> **Shortfall:** 113,000 GP  
> **Timeline Remaining:** 9 days  
> **Status:** 88.7% complete

So close.

***

Asterion crossed his arms. "One hundred thirteen thousand short. Nine days left. What now?"

"One more trade," Victor said.

He opened the Galactic Exchange.

Searched: **Ultra high-margin items, 100k+ profit potential**.

Three results appeared.

Victor selected the first.

> **[Dungeon Core Seed]**
> **World:** 22-F (Collapsed Kingdom - Salvage Market)
> **Purchase Price:** 85,000 GP
> **Terra-Insolvia Resale Estimate:** 250,000+ GP
> **Profit Potential:** 165,000 GP (194% ROI)
> **Legal Status:** RESTRICTED (Import prohibited in 12 kingdoms including Terra-Insolvia)
> **Risk Level:** HIGH

Nova's light flared red. "Victor. That's a DUNGEON CORE SEED. Importing that is **illegal**. Imperial law classifies it as strategic military asset. If Customs finds it, they confiscate everything and arrest you for smuggling."

"If I don't hit one million gold, the Consortium terminates my contract anyway," Victor said. "Same result, different bureaucracy."

"This is insane."

"This is necessary."

He calculated the timeline.

**Dungeon Core Seed Delivery:** 48 hours (Day 23)  
**Customs Summons:** 72 hours (Day 20... wait, that was today)

Victor checked the date.

The summons was for **three days from Day 17** = Day 20.

Today was Day 21.

He'd **missed** the Customs summons.

"ARMI, flag that," Victor said. "I ignored an Imperial summons. What's the consequence?"

> **[ARMI - Legal Analysis]**
> **Missed Imperial Summons:** Automatic warrant issuance
> **Timeline:** 24-48 hours
> **Enforcement Action:** Asset seizure authorization + detention

"They'll come for you," Asterion said.

"In forty-eight hours," Victor countered. "Same timeline as the Core Seed delivery."

He purchased it.

> **[Purchase Confirmed]**
> **Item:** [Dungeon Core Seed]  
> **Cost:** 85,000 GP  
> **Delivery:** 48 hours (Day 23, dawn)  
> **Status:** IN TRANSIT

Nova's light pulsed frantically. "Victor. You just bet everything on a twenty-four-hour window to sell the most illegal item you've ever touched, before Imperial authorities arrest you for ignoring a summons."

Victor leaned back.

"Good thing I work well under pressure."
