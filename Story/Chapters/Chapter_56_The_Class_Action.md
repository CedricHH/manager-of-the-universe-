# Chapter 56: The Class Action

The morning audit was going exceptionally well, which was usually a sign that something terrible was about to happen.

Victor sat behind his obsidian desk—a piece of furniture he’d looted from the previous floor boss and repurposed—and scrolled through the holographic screens of the ARMI interface. The numbers were beautiful. Symmetrical. Efficient.

> **[Daily Report: Insolvia Holdings]**
> **Visitor Count**: 412 (↑ 15%)
> **Potion Sales**: 840 Units (↑ 8%)
> **Loot Distribution**: 98% Satisfaction Rate
> **Net Revenue**: 4,200 Gold Pieces (Annualized)

"Productivity is up," Victor murmured, highlighting a cell on the spectral spreadsheet. "The new vending slimes in Sector 4 have reduced queue times by 22%. Excellent."

Asterion, currently standing guard by the heavy oak door, grunted. The Minotaur was sharpening his axe with a delicate whetstone, the *shhh-shhh* sound providing a rhythmic background noise to Victor’s calculations.

"Peace is profitable," Asterion said, his deep voice vibrating through the floorboards. "But it makes me uneasy, Boss. The herd is too quiet."

"It’s not peace, Asterion. It’s market dominance," Victor corrected without looking up. "When you control the supply, the demand learns to behave."

Then the door burst open.

It wasn't an attack. It was a delivery. But judging by the look on Valerius's face, a fireball would have been preferable. The former Merchant Guild auditor, now wearing the grey-and-gold livery of Insolvia's "Compliance Department," stumbled into the room clutching a scroll sealed with red wax.

"Sir!" Valerius gasped, adjusting his crooked spectacles. "It’s... it’s a standard service... I mean... a priority notification!"

Victor didn’t blink. "Valerius, breathe. Oxygen deprivation reduces cognitive function. Is the Dungeon Core unstable?"

"No, sir."

"Are the goblins unionizing again?"

"No, sir."

"Then give me the paper."

Valerius handed it over with trembling fingers. Victor broke the seal—the crest of the Adventurer Guild, a sword crossed over a shield. He scanned the document. His expression didn't change, but the temperature in the room seemed to drop five degrees.

"Read it to me," Victor said, tossing the scroll back to Valerius. "I want to hear you say the words."

Valerius swallowed hard. "It’s a 'Motion for Emergency Injunctive Relief,' filed by Inspector Vorne. He’s petitioning the Crown Magistrate to suspend all operations of Insolvia Holdings immediately."

"On what grounds?"

"Public Safety Risk," Valerius squeaked. "He cites the upcoming Royal Visit. He claims an 'unregulated hyper-magical zone'—that's us—poses an unacceptable threat to Crown Prince Aldric's security. If the Magistrate signs this, the Guild can legally seal the entrance with a Class 5 Barrier."

Victor leaned back, tenting his fingers. *Vorne.* The bureaucrat he’d met a week ago. The man who had looked at a dungeon filled with monsters and only cared about the permits.

"Timeline?" Victor asked.

"The hearing is in forty-eight hours," Valerius said. "If the junction is granted, we’re closed before the Prince’s carriage even enters the city limits."

Victor tapped the desk. *T-minus 71 hours to the Royal Visit. Vorne is clearing the board. He knows he can't shut me down permanently without a year-long investigation, so he’s going for a temporary restraining order. Once the doors are sealed, he’ll delay the reopening indefinitely while he 'investigates.' It’s a pocket veto.*

It was a smart move. Inefficient, malicious, and blatantly anti-competitive. Victor respected it.

"We cannot fight this in the Guild Courts," Asterion warned, stopping his sharpening. "The judges are retired adventurers. They will side with their own."

"Correct," Victor said. "In a rigged market, you don't play by the rules. You change the venue."

"Do we kill the Magistrate?" Sniv asked, popping his head out from under the desk where he had been reorganizing Victor’s paperclips by color.

"No, Sniv. Legal murder is expensive. It’s called war, and we aren't there yet." Victor stood up and walked to the balcony.

Below, the Dungeon Lobby was thriving. It looked less like a monster cave/den and more like a bustling airport terminal. Parties were forming up near the Quest Board. A group of novices was haggling with a slime over the price of a torch. It was a functioning ecosystem.

"Vorne treats this place like a monster den," Victor said softly. "He thinks of us as a 'Hazard.' A problem to be contained."

He turned back to his team. A Minotaur, a Goblin, and a corrupt Auditor. The Board of Directors.

"He forgets that to these people," Victor pointed down at the adventurers, "we aren't a hazard. We’re a service provider. We are the only dungeon in the kingdom that offers fair XP ratios, guaranteed loot drops, and clean restrooms."

"Sir?" Valerius asked.

"Valerius, what happens if the Crown tries to ban cheap ale?"

"The taverns riot."

"And what happens if they try to shut down the only source of reliable income for the city's freelance workforce?"

Victor smiled. It was the smile of a man who just found a loophole in a contract written in blood.

"Sniv," Victor barked.

The goblin snapped to attention. "Yes, Boss!"

"Initiate Project Grassroots. Go down to the lobby. Talk to the regulars. The Iron Wolves. The solo grinders. Tell them the 'Fat Cats' at the Guild HQ—the ones who sit in stone towers eating grapes—are trying to shut us down."

Sniv’s eyes widened. "Fat Cats... taking loot?"

"Exactly. Tell them the Guild wants to protect the 'Status Quo.' Tell them they want to keep the little guy at Level 5 forever."

"Sniv is on it!" The goblin grabbed a megaphone and scrambled for the door.

"Valerius," Victor pivoted to the human. "Draft a counter-petition. Not from me. From *them*. A Class Action Lawsuit. ' The Independent Adventurers Alliance vs. The Adventurer Guild Regulatory Body.' We are alleging 'Restriction of Trade,' 'Unfair Labor Practices,' and 'Monopolistic Gatekeeping.'"

Valerius looked faint. "Sir... adventurers don't sue Guilds. They work for them."

"Not these adventurers," Victor said. "These are the outcasts. The ones the Guild ignores. The freelancers. Today, they aren't warriors. They are Plaintiffs."

Victor checked his internal clock. *46 hours remaining.*

"I want five hundred signatures by noon tomorrow. Offer a signing bonus."

"A bonus?" Valerius asked, pen hovering over his scroll.

"One free Minor Healing Potion for every verified signature. And a raffle ticket for a +1 Iron Sword."

> **[ARMI]**
> Transaction: [Grassroots Campaign]
> Cost: 500 x Minor Potion (Inventory Value: 125g) + 1 Sword (20g)
> Projected ROI: Political Leverage, Injunction Delay
> Status: APPROVED

**The Lobby - Lower Level**

Sniv stood on a crate of Healing Potions, looking out over the sea of adventurers. He felt tall.

"LISTEN!" Sniv shouted, his voice amplified by a wind-rune Victor had glued to the megaphone.

The chatter in the lobby died down. A barbarian named Gork looked up from his sandwich. "What is it, little guy? New boss spawn?"

"WORSE!" Sniv yelled, waving his arms. "Big Bosses in City! The ones with the shiny capes! They want to CLOSE the dungeon!"

A murmur went through the crowd.

"Close it?" a rogue asked, stepping forward. "Why? The farming here is great. I made three levels this week."

"Because they hate you!" Sniv pointed an accusatory green finger at the ceiling. "They say you are 'Unsafe.' They say you need 'Supervision.' They want you to go back to the Swamp of Despair where the drop rates are 0.01%!"

"I hate the Swamp," Gork grunted. "Leeches."

"They want to take your loot!" Sniv screamed, hitting the high notes. "They want to protect their monopoly! Are you going to let them?"

"NO!" a few voices shouted.

"Then sign!" Sniv gestured to Valerius, who had set up a table with a stack of parchment. "Sign the paper! Save the Loot! And... *free potion*!"

The words "free potion" caused a stampede. Valerius yelped as the line formed instantly, stretching out the tunnel entrance.

**The Town Hall - 48 Hours Later**

The Magistrates Court was a stuffy, wood-paneled room designed to make poor people feel small and rich people feel bored.

Inspector Vorne stood before the bench, looking impeccable in his navy-blue uniform. He checked his pocket watch. 09:00 AM.

"Your Honor," Vorne addressed the Magistrate, a portly man named Judge Halloway who was sweating profusely despite the cool morning. "This is a simple procedural matter. The Insolvia Anomaly is an unregistered magical hazard. With the Crown Prince arriving tomorrow, we cannot risk a mana surge or a monster breakout. The Guild requests an immediate seal order."

Judge Halloway wiped his forehead. "Yes, Inspector. It seems straightforward. Standard safety protocol..."

"Objection!"

Vorne turned. He didn't see a lawyer. He saw Victor Kaine.

The Dungeon Manager walked into the court wearing a suit that cost more than Vorne’s annual salary. It was black silk, cut in a style that was fashionable in the Imperial Capital—or perhaps in another dimension entirely.

"Mr. Kaine," Vorne said coldly. "This is a closed hearing."

"It involves my property," Victor said, placing a briefcase on the defense table. "And more importantly, it involves the livelihoods of my stakeholders."

"Stakeholders?" Vorne scoffed. "You run a monster pit. You don't have stakeholders."

"I beg to differ." Victor gestured to the double doors at the back of the room. "May I?"

The Judge nodded weakly.

Victor snapped his fingers.

The doors swung open.

The noise hit them first. A roar of conversation, chanting, and clanking armor. The Town Square outside wasn't empty. It was packed.

Hundreds of adventurers stood outside, holding placards.

*HANDS OFF MY DUNGEON.*
*VOTE NO ON CLOSURE.*
*VORNE HATES PUPPIES.* (Sniv had added that one).

"Your Honor," Victor said, pulling a scroll from his briefcase that was so long it unrolled across the floor and hit Vorne’s boots. "I present a Class Action Petition signed by eight hundred and forty-two registered freelancers. They attest that closing Insolvia Holdings would constitute 'Irreparable Economic Harm' to the local economy."

Vorne stared at the scroll. He saw signatures. Thumbprints. Clan seals.

"This is ridiculous," Vorne hissed. "You bribed them."

"I offered a loyalty program," Victor corrected. "It’s standard customer retention." He turned to the Judge. "Your Honor, if you grant this injunction, you aren't just closing a dungeon. You are putting eight hundred armed mercenaries out of work on the very day the Prince arrives. Do you really want eight hundred bored, angry, unemployed warriors wandering the streets while His Highness is waving from his carriage?"

The color drained from Judge Halloway’s face.

"Civil unrest..." the Judge whispered. "Security nightmare."

"Exactly," Victor said smoothly. "My client—myself—proposes a compromise. Keep the dungeon open. Let the adventurers grind. Keep them busy, happy, and off the streets."

The Judge banged his gavel before Vorne could even open his mouth.

"Motion for Injunction denied!" Halloway shouted. "The status quo shall be maintained pending a full Royal Review... *after* the Prince departs. Court adjourned!"

The Judge fled the chamber through the back door.

Victor began packing up his scroll. "Pleasure doing business with you, Inspector."

Vorne didn't move. He stood statue-still, his eyes fixed on Victor. The bureaucrat wasn't angry. He was focused.

"You maneuver well, Kaine," Vorne said quietly. The chaotic noise of the cheering crowd outside seemed to fade. "You used the mob to force a stalemate. Very political."

"I'm a businessman, Inspector. I protect my assets."

"You bought time," Vorne said, stepping closer. "Seventy-two hours. But you made a tactical error."

"Oh?"

"You argued that the dungeon is a 'Vital Workplace.' That brings you under the jurisdiction of the Labor Safety Laws."

Victor’s hand paused on the clasp of his briefcase.

Vorne smiled. It was a thin, predatory thing. "The Magistrate won't close you. But *I* can suspend you for safety violations. If I find a single hazard—a trap with the wrong tension, a monster without a containment collar, a slippery floor—I can shut you down under Section 14 of the Workplace Safety Act."

"You want to inspect the dungeon?"

"No," Vorne said. "I'm sending a 'Stress Test Team.' The Crimson Blades. They arrive tomorrow at dawn. They will run your dungeon at maximum difficulty. If they die? You're a murder pit. If they get hurt? You're negligent. If they breeze through it? You're boring and I'll revoke your threat rating."

Vorne put on his cap.

"Survive that, Mr. Manager."

The Inspector walked out, leaving Victor alone in the silent courtroom.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Warning**: Regulatory Threat upgraded.
> **Incoming Asset**: The Crimson Blades (Rank: Platinum).
> **Objective**: Compliance Failure.
> **Probability of Business Continuity**: 12%.

Victor stared at the red text floating in his vision.

"Asterion," he whispered into his communication crystal.

"Boss?"

"Cancel the goblin coffee break. We have an audit incoming."

## Author's Note
Victor wins the battle of public opinion but triggers a much more dangerous bureaucratic weapon: The Safety Audit. The Crimson Blades are not just heroes; they are *compliance officers with swords*.
