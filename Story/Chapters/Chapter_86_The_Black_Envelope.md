# Chapter 86: The Black Envelope

The dust from the implosion of the Spire Garden mines did not settle like normal dust. It hung in the air, glittering with the suspended particulate of vaporized mana stones, casting a prism of golden light over the ruin.

Governor Malphas was screaming.

It wasn't a scream of pain, but of indignity. Two Imperial Guards—massive men in the grey steel-plate of the Bureau’s Enforcement Division—were dragging the Duke by his velvet armpits towards a waiting prisoner carriage. Malphas kicked and thrashed, his heels scraping furrows into the manicured lawn he had once owned.

"My Clause! My asset!" Malphas shrieked, his voice cracking. "He stole the explosion! That’s illegal! You can’t liquidate a kinetic event! It’s against the laws of physics!"

Victor Kaine watched the scene from the terrace balcony, sipping a glass of lukewarm water he’d found on an abandoned serving tray.

"Physics is just another regulatory body," Victor murmured to himself. "And like all regulators, it can be lobbied."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Transaction Complete:** [Asset Liquidation: Kinetic Event]
> **Yield:** +45,200 GP
> **Gold Toxicity:** 12% (Stabilizing)
> **Note:** Your blood is currently 14% molten gold. Please avoid magnetic fields.

Victor swirled the water. His hand trembled slightly—a side effect of the toxicity, or perhaps the adrenaline of the gamble. He had bet his life on the ability to monetize a detonating mana-bomb before the shockwave could liquefy his internal organs.

ROI: Positive. Always positive.

"You are insane."

The voice came from behind him. Thaddeus Vane stood in the doorway of the terrace. The Senior Partner looked perfectly composed, as if he hadn't just witnessed a mountain implode and turn into currency. Only the slight tightening of his jaw betrayed his stress.

"I am efficient, Thaddeus," Victor corrected, turning to face his recruiter. "There is a difference. Insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results. Efficiency is doing something once, terrifying everyone involved, and profiting from the trauma."

Vane walked to the railing, looking down at the crater where the mine had been. It was a perfect bowl of smooth, fused glass.

"That mine was supposed to be a distressed asset for Project Valoria," Vane said quietly. "You didn't reorganize it. You... deleted it."

"I converted it," Victor said. "The mine was a liability. The explosion was an asset. I merely accelerated the liquidity event. the Empire gets the land—which is now perfectly graded and ready for new construction. I keep the liquid capital. Malphas goes to prison for reckless endangerment. Everybody wins."

"Except Malphas."

"Malphas was a bad manager. His liquidation was inevitable."

Vane sighed, a long, weary sound that spoke of a man who had spent too many years reading audit reports. "The Bureau is terrified of you, Victor. Do you know that? Half the Board wants to arrest you for unlicensed use of Imperial-grade magic. The other half wants to promote you to Grand Auditor immediately just so they can assign you to a hostile nation."

"I prefer the freelance life," Victor said. "Less paperwork."

"Is it?"

Vane’s eyes flickered down to Victor’s left hand.

Victor wasn't holding the glass of water anymore. He was holding the envelope Hestia had pressed into his chest moments before the chaos erupted.

It was black. Not the black of ink or dye, but the black of a void—a rectangular hole in reality that seemed to absorb the light around it. It had no seal, no stamp, and no address.

"Hestia gave you that," Vane said. It wasn't a question.

"She did."

"Do you know what it is?"

"I have a theory," Victor said.

Vane took a half-step back, creating distance between himself and the envelope. "Hestia isn't just a Senior Partner, Victor. She... consults. For a higher bracket of management. If she gave you that, she's not marking you as a target. She's marking you as a candidate."

"For what?"

Vane shook his head. "I don't know. And I don't want to know. My ambition ends at the Imperial borders, Victor. Whatever is in that envelope... it comes from somewhere else."

Vane straightened his grey coat. "I will handle the Governor. The Empire accepts your... *contribution* to the treasury, minus a 30% tax on the liquidation yield."

"Fifteen percent," Victor countered instinctively.

"Twenty. And you leave Aethelgard within the hour. Before the magical fallout settles and mutates the local wildlife."

"Deal."

Vane looked at Victor one last time—a mixture of respect and profound relief that he was leaving. Then he turned and walked away, barking orders at the guards.

Victor was alone.

He looked down at the envelope.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Object Detected:** [The Black Envelope]
> **Class:** Cosmic/Admin
> **Origin:** Galactic Audit Consortium [Human Resources Division]
> **Warning:** Opening this object constitutes acceptance of a Binding Service Agreement.

Victor smiled. The Toxicity in his veins buzzed, a warm, golden hum.

"Let's see the offer."

***

Victor didn't open the envelope on the balcony. He waited until he was in the private carriage Thaddeus had arranged, rattling over the cobblestones away from the smoking crater.

He sat on the plush velvet seat, the curtains drawn. He placed the envelope on the small folding table.

"Open," he commanded.

He didn't use his hands. He used `[Authority]`.

The black envelope didn't tear; it dissolved. The darkness melted away like smoke, revealing a single card made of a material that looked like obsidian but felt like warm skin.

Text began to burn itself onto the surface of the card. It wasn't in Imperial Common, or Goblin, or any language of this world. It was written in the jagged, shifting glyphs of the Universal Standard—the language of the System itself.

Thanks to his `[Asset Manager]` class, the translation overlay appeared instantly in his mind.

> **RECRUITMENT OFFER: TIER 4**
>
> **TO:** Entity #8940-Victor (Designation: "The Chainsaw")

> 5. **OVERSIGHT**: Subject agrees to random spot-audits by Senior Management.

Victor read the terms twice.

He laughed. It was a sharp, dry sound.

"Refused," he said.

The card pulsed red.

> **[System Alert]**
> Refusal of a Consortium Draft is categorized as "Asset Insurbordination."
> Penalty: **Liquidation**.

"I didn't say I refuse the job," Victor said to the empty air. "I refuse the *terms*. Fifty percent franchise fee? For a Tier 4 world? That's robbery. Even a goblin wouldn't sign that."

He leaned forward, his eyes flashing with the blue light of his `[Performance Review]` skill.

"ARMI. Activate Editor Mode."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Mode:** Contract Revision
> **Target:** [Cosmic Service Agreement]
> **Warning:** Attempting to edit a Consortium document requires [Authority Level 3] or higher. You are Level 2.
> **Risk:** Cerebral hemorrhage.

"Do it."

White hot pain spiked behind his eyes. Victor ignored it. He focused his will on the obsidian card, visualizing a red pen—the same red pen he had used for twenty years in corporate boardrooms on Earth to strike through bad clauses.

"Item 4," Victor snarled, stabbing his finger onto the card. "Fifty percent is standard for a *supported* asset. You sent me here with nothing. No capital, no staff, no body. I built this portfolio from zero. This is a Bootstrap Startup, not a Franchise."

The glyphs on the card shimmered, resisting. The card heated up, scorching the varnish on the table.

Victor pushed harder. He poured his mana—his gold—into the argument.

"I am assuming all the risk," Victor hissed. "I am the one dealing with local Guilds, the Church, and the Crown. If I fail, you write off the world. If I succeed, you get a purified asset for free. You want a piece of my action? fine. But you pay the market rate."

He slashed his finger across the '50%'.

"Ten percent. Finder's fee. Standard industry practice."

The card vibrated violently. A crack appeared in the table.

> **[Consortium AI]**
> **Objection:** 10% is below the operational floor for Sector 7.
> **Counter-Offer:** 40%. Plus Dental.

"I don't need dental. I have a healer on retainer. Fifteen percent. And I want autonomy. No random spot-audits. I submit a quarterly report. You read it. If the numbers are green, you stay out of my way."

> **[Consortium AI]**
> **Objection:** Autonomy requires Senior Partner status.
> **Counter-Offer:** 35%. One audit per year.

"Twenty percent," Victor countered, his nose beginning to bleed. The mental pressure was like a vice clamping down on his skull. His veins burned hot—the molten gold in his blood reacting violently to the cold void magic of the contract.

"Twenty percent. And I get access to the **Galactic Exchange** immediately. No waiting period."

The card glowed blindingly white. The air in the carriage grew cold.

> **[Consortium AI]**
> **Processing...**
> **Processing...**
> **Asset Valuation Analysis:** Subject 'Victor' is currently the only viable restructuring agent on the planet. Previous agent (#402 - Necromancer class) has underperformed for three centuries.
> **Leverage:** High.

Victor wiped the blood from his lip. "Exactly. You need me. I don't need you. I can conquer this world the hard way if I have to. But you... you have quotas to meet."

The glow faded. The text on the card rearranged itself.

> **FINAL TERMS:**
>
> **Role:** Independent Contractor (Consultant Class)
> **Jurisdiction:** Terra-Insolvia
> **Fee:** 25% of Yields (Non-negotiable).
> **Benefits:** access to Galactic Exchange (Tier 1).
> **Oversight:** Quarterly Performance Review. Zero operational interference as long as ROI remains positive.
>
> **SPECIAL CONDITION:**
> To validate Contractor status, Subject must prove efficiency.
> **Mission:** Generate **1,000,000 GP** in liquid capital within **30 Days**.
> **Failure Condition:** Contract voided. Subject terminated.

Victor stared at the number.

One million gold.

His current liquidation of the mine—the biggest score of his life—was 45,000 GP. To hit a million in a month wasn't just ambitious. It was mathematically impossible using standard dungeon economics.

He would have to liquidate entire cities. Or...

He would have to change the economy itself.

Victor smiled. The pain in his head vanished, replaced by the cool clarity of a locked target.

"Twenty-five percent," he muttered. "Stiff. But fair."

He pressed his thumb against the card.

"Accepted."

The card dissolved into golden dust, which swirled and shot into his chest.

> **[ARMI]**
> **System Upgrade Initiated...**
> **Authority Level Up:** Level 2 → Level 2.5 (Consultant)
> **New Feature Unlocked:** [The Galactic Exchange]
> **Quest Received:** [The Million Gold Month]
> **Time Remaining:** 29 Days, 23 Hours, 59 Minutes.

Victor leaned back in the seat, closing his eyes. The carriage bumped along the road, carrying him south, back towards the border. Back to Oakhaven.

A million gold.

He opened his eyes. He tapped the window divider.

"Driver," Victor called out. "Can this thing go faster? I'm on a deadline."

" Sir, we're already pushing the horses!"

"Then bribe them," Victor said, tossing a pouch of 50 gold through the slot. "Feed them mana potions. Run them until they explode and buy new ones. Whatever it takes."

He pulled out his notebook—the physical one. He turned to a fresh page.

**OBJECTIVE: 1,000,000 GP**

He wrote down three words.

*1. The Franchise.*
*2. The Church.*
*3. The War.*

He underlined the last one.

"Sniv," he whispered to the empty carriage. "I hope you ironed my best suit. We’re going public."
