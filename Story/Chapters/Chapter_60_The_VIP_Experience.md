# Chapter 60: The VIP Experience

"This place reeks of death," High Priestess Aurelia said, her voice echoing in the polished lobby.

"That is the scent of *Efficiency*, Your Holiness," Victor corrected smoothly, offering a tray of crystal goblets. "And lavender. We use a proprietary blend to keep the workspace stimulating."

Aurelia didn't take a drink. She held her staff like a weapon, the sun-crystal tip pulsating with a rhythm that made Victor's teeth ache. Every pulse sent a wave of 'Purification' scanning the room.

*She’s a walking Geiger counter for dark magic,* Victor realized. *And I’m standing on top of a nuclear reactor.*

Prince Aldric, on the other hand, was delighted. He took a goblet, sniffed it, and took a sip.

"Exquisite," the Prince said. "Is this chilled with...?"

"Cryo-Slime extract," Victor lied. (It was just ice, but royals loved exotic adjectives). "Sustainable and zero-carbon footprint."

"Fascinating." Aldric walked over to the reception desk, where Sniv was standing on a crate, sweating through his maid outfit. The goblin curstyed so hard he nearly tipped over.

"Greetings, Your High-ness!" Sniv squeaked. "Welcome to Insolvia! Please do not kill us!"

"Charming," Aldric laughed. "A talking servant. Is he a construct?"

"He is a local hire," Victor said. "We believe in upskilling the indigenous population. It reduces crime rates and fosters community integration."

Aurelia walked past them, her eyes scanning the shadows. "You dress monsters in human clothes and teach them to beg. It is a mockery of the Natural Order."

"It is a business model," Victor said, his smile tight. "Shall we proceed with the tour? I have cleared the schedule for your exclusive inspection."

**Floor 1: The Production Line**

Victor led them past the Slime Vats. Usually, this area was a chaotic mess of adventurers farming gel. Today, it was a synchronized factory.

Kobolds with rakes were 'herding' slimes into designated spawning zones.
Mages (hired freelancers) were casting targeted lightning bolts to harvest them instantly.
Goblins were collecting the loot in buckets.

"Notice the throughput," Victor gestured. "Traditional dungeons rely on random encounters. We have industrialized the spawn cycle. We produce three hundred liters of alchemical base per hour."

Aldric watched a slime explode into gold coins. His eyes glimmered.

"And the revenue?" the Prince asked.

"Significant," Victor said. "And taxable. If the regulatory framework allows for it."

Aldric nodded slowly. "Taxable. Yes. The Treasury is always... fond of new revenue streams."

"Abomination," Aurelia spat. She pointed her staff at a slime. "These creatures are born of corruption. You mass-produce them like cattle?"

"We supply the potion market," Victor argued. "Without this slime, the price of healing potions in Oakhaven would triple. Are you suggesting we deny affordable healthcare to the poor, High Priestess?"

Aurelia turned on him. Her eyes were burning white. "Do not preach morality to me, Merchant. I see what you are. You monetize suffering."

"I monetize demand," Victor countered.

"Show me the defenses," Aurelia demanded. "The Prince is not here to inspect a farm. He is here to assess a *threat*. Can this facility defend the Realm? Or is it just a parasite?"

Victor checked his ARMI interface.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Threat Assessment**: Aurelia requires a demonstration.
> **Constraint**: Lethal Force prohibited. Dark Magic prohibited.
> **Recommendation**: Theatricality.

"We have excellent security," Victor said. "Please. Step into the Arena."

***

**The Arena (Formerly the Wolf Den)**

Victor had cleared the room. The pillars were polished. The floor was sanded.

"Release the assets," Victor whispered into his comms crystal.

A gate rumbled open.

Six Iron Wolves bounded out. They were massive, their fur like steel wire, their eyes glowing red.

Aldric took a step back. The Royal Guards tensed.

"Hold fire," Victor ordered. "Observe."

Kael stepped out from the opposite gate. He wasn't wearing his usual grim mercenary gear. He was wearing... a cape. A bright red cape. And he was holding a whip.

"Hup!" Kael shouted.

 The wolves didn't attack. They *circled*.

At Kael’s signal, the wolves leaped—not at him, but *over* him. They performed a synchronized figure-eight weave.

Then, Kael snapped the whip. The wolves lunged at a set of wooden dummies set up in the center.

*CRUNCH.*
*SNAP.*
*TEAR.*

In three seconds, the dummies were sawdust. The wolves sat down and waited for treats.

"Precision," Victor said. "Discipline. These aren't wild beasts, Your Highness. They are a K-9 Unit. Loyal. Trainable. And ready to serve the Crown's interests."

Aldric clapped. "Bravo! A dancing wolf pack! I must have one for the Palace."

Aurelia was not clapping.

"Tricks," she scoffed. "A circus act. What happens when they face *Holy* power?"

She didn't wait for an answer. She slammed her staff into the ground.

"ILLUMINATE!"

A shockwave of white light blasted across the arena.

The wolves howled in pain as the holy magic burned their shadow-infused fur. They scrambled back, whimpering.

Kael shielded his eyes. "Hey! That wasn't in the script!"

Aurelia pointed her staff at the center of the room. The light coalesced into a shape. A warrior made of pure sunlight—a **Sun-Construct**. It was ten feet tall, holding a burning spear.

"Defend against *that*, Dungeon Master," Aurelia challenged. "If your facility is an asset, let it prove it can stand against the Light."

Victor’s heart skipped a beat. A Sun-Construct was a Level 35 summon. It would vaporize the wolves. It would melt Kael's armor.

If Asterion fought it, he'd have to use his Nether-Axe. And that would reveal the dark nature of the dungeon.

Victor needed a third option.

"System," he hissed. "Do we have anything... reflective?"

> **[ARMI]**
> **Inventory Search**: Mirror Shield (broken).
> **Alternative**: Slime Gel (Prismatic Variety).
> **Properties**: High refraction index.

Victor smiled.

"Sniv!" he shouted. "Deploy the 'Disco Protocol'!"

"DISCO!" Sniv yelled from the balcony.

The goblin pulled a lever.

The ceiling hatches opened. Hundreds of gallons of translucent, prismatic slime gel poured down—right onto the Sun-Construct.

The Construct raised its burning spear... and sizzled.

The light didn't go out. It *refracted*. The clear slime acted like a million tiny prisms. The concentrated beam of the Construct was scattered into a harmless, blinding rainbow display of color. The lobby suddenly looked like a rave.

The Construct couldn't focus its energy. It flailed, slipping on the goo, shooting harmless beams of pink and green light into the walls.

Aldric laughed. He laughed so hard he had to hold onto a pillar.

"It's... it's magnificent!" the Prince gasped, wiping a tear from his eye. "You neutralized a Divine Guardian with... goop! And it's pretty!"

Aurelia stared at her Summon, which was currently doing the splits on the slippery floor while flashing like a disco ball. The dignity of the Church was evaporating by the second.

"Enough!" Aurelia dispelled the construct. The light vanished. The slime remained.

She turned to Victor with cold fury. "You mock the power of the Sun."

"I demonstrated versatility," Victor said, bowing. "The Crown faces many threats. Not all can be fought with swords. Sometimes, you need... flexibility."

Aldric stepped forward, stepping gingerly over a puddle of slime.

"I like him," Aldric announced. "He's funny. And he's effective."

The Prince looked at Victor. The boredom was gone from his eyes. Replaced by a sharp, calculating intelligence that surprised Victor.

"Walk with me, Mr. Kaine," Aldric said. "Alone."

***

**The Corridor**

They walked away from the group. Aldric stopped near a jagged scar in the wall—a remnant of the Crimson Blades' attack.

"My father is broke," Aldric said casually.

Victor blinked. He hadn't expected the Prince to lead with that.

"I... beg your pardon?"

"The Kingdom," Aldric said, examining his fingernails. "We're drowning in debt. The wars in the North. The Church's tithes. The Guild's monopoly fees. We are asset-rich and cash-poor."

He turned to Victor.

"You are a rogue element. Aurelia wants to burn you because she can't control you. The Guild wants to close you because you threaten their profits."

"And you, Your Highness?"

"I want to know if you can pay," Aldric said. "You claimed you could be a 'Gold Mine.' Was that a metaphor?"

"No," Victor said. "It was a projection."

Victor pulled a notepad from his pocket.

"I can generate 5,000 gold pieces a month in net revenue. Tax-free. Unregulated. Potions. Loot. XP farming fees."

Aldric whistled. "5,000. That would pay for a new regiment."

"I offer a partnership," Victor proposed. "I remain independent. The Guild stays off my back. The Church stays out of my lobby. In exchange... the Crown receives a 15% 'Consulting Fee'. Direct deposit. Discretionary funds."

"20%," Aldric countered instantly.

"15%," Victor held firm. "But I'll throw in a custom set of Enchanted Armor for your personal guard."

Aldric smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. It was the smile of a desperate landlord finding a tenant who pays cash.

"Done," Aldric shook his hand. "I will grant you a Royal Charter. 'Provisional Status'. It overrides the Guild's injunction."

"And the Priestess?"

"Let me handle Aurelia. She serves the Gods, but even the Temple needs donations."

They turned back to the group.

Victor felt a wave of relief. He had bought the Prince. He had won.

But as they approached the lobby, the air grew cold again.

Aurelia was standing by the entrance to the lower floors. She wasn't looking at the slime anymore.

She was holding a compass. A golden compass that was spinning wildly.

"Aldric," she called out. Her voice was no longer angry. It was terrified.

"What is it?" the Prince asked.

"I am detecting a Core," Aurelia whispered. "Not a monster core. A *World* Core."

She pointed her staff directly at the heavy iron door that led to the Heart of the Dungeon—where Nova was hiding.

"There is something ancient down there," Aurelia said. "Something forbidden."

> **[ARMI]**
> **CRITICAL ALERT**: Divine Scan penetrating shielding.
> **Exposure Probability**: 99%.
> **Action Required**: IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION.

Victor froze. The Prince's Charter couldn't save him from this. If she found Nova, she would call down an orbital strike.

"That," Victor interrupted loudly, stepping between her and the door. "That is the... Executive Washroom. Very private."

Aurelia raised her staff. The tip began to glow with a light that wasn't for show. It was a Bunker-Buster spell.

"Move," she commanded.

**Status**: The Prince is bought. But the Priestess is about to breach.

## Author's Note
Victor survives the political test only to face the theological one. The dynamic of "Science/Business vs. Faith" is established. The interaction with Aldric reveals the Prince isn't just a fop—he's broke and corruptible, which is a useful flaw.
