# Chapter 9: Integration

The new goblins ate last.

Victor watched from his throne as the feeding order established itself. Original fourteen first—moving through the ration line with the casual confidence of employees who had survived the first layoffs. Then the probationary twelve, shuffling forward with heads bowed, accepting whatever scraps remained.

It was natural hierarchy. Predictable. Manageable.

Until Guard-2 decided to test the boundaries.

The goblin was one of the larger originals—not the brightest, but strong enough to matter. He had been with Victor from the beginning, had fought in the Floor Three takeover, had earned his position through reliable violence.

Now he stood over a new recruit, hand extended, demanding.

"Give."

The recruit—a scrawny thing Victor had designated Labor-15—clutched his mushroom ration with both hands. "Is mine. Boss said—"

"I said *give*."

Guard-2 snatched the mushroom and stuffed it into his mouth, chewing with deliberate slowness. Around them, the other goblins watched. Waiting. Learning.

Victor didn't move.

*This isn't disobedience. This is internal politics. Handle it wrong, and I undermine Guard-2's authority. Handle it right, and I establish precedent without direct intervention.*

The mushroom disappeared. Guard-2 grunted satisfaction and walked away. Labor-15 looked at Victor with eyes that held something between hope and despair.

Victor looked back. Said nothing.

The message was clear: *Solve your own problems.*

Labor-15 would remember this. He would either find a way to protect his rations—alliances, strength, cleverness—or he would continue to be a victim. Either way, he would learn.

Everyone learned, eventually.

---

The next morning, Victor called a general meeting.

Twenty-four goblins gathered in the Chamber, arranged in a loose semicircle around the throne. The original fourteen stood at the front, comfortable in their seniority. The probationary twelve clustered at the back, uncertain of their place.

Sniv stood at Victor's right hand, clipboard ready.

"We have a problem," Victor announced. His voice echoed off stone walls. "We have enough goblins to expand operations. We have enough food to keep everyone fed. But we don't have motivation."

The goblins stared at him. Motivation was not a concept they were familiar with.

"The current resource distribution model is decoupled from individual performance. Work hard, work lazy—the allocation remains static. We are subsidizing inefficiency." Victor shook his head. "That's not how successful organizations work."

The goblins blinked. Several of them looked at Sniv, hoping for a translation, but even the HR Manager looked stumped by 'decoupled.'

One guard scratched his head with a blunt claw, his expression a mask of pure, concentrated incomprehension.

He reached into the pile of salvaged adventurer equipment and withdrew something that caught the torchlight.

A piece of golden trim. Decorative. Worthless in terms of function.

But oh, how it *gleamed*.

The goblins leaned forward as one. Yellow eyes went wide. Several of them actually drooled.

"This," Victor said, holding the piece of trim as if it were a holy relic, "is an Employee of the Week incentive. Or, as you call it: a Shiny."

"Shiny," Sniv repeated reverently. "Very shiny."

"Starting today, we implement a new system: Merit Points." Victor held up the gold trim, letting it catch the light. "Every goblin starts at zero. Good work earns points. Bad work loses points. At the end of each week, the goblin with the highest points gets this—plus extra rations."

> **[ARMI - INCENTIVE STRUCTURE]**
> System: Merit-Based Reward (v1.0)
> Currency: Points (Non-Transferable)
> Tracking: Sniv (HR Department)
> Rewards: +1 Ration, Decorative Item ("Shiny")
> Projection: 40% productivity increase within 2 cycles
> Note: Primitive gamification. Effective for low-INT workforce.

The goblins erupted in excited chatter. Points. Shinies. Competition.

Guard-2 pushed to the front. "How Guard-2 get points?"

Victor looked at him—the same goblin who had stolen a ration not twelve hours ago.

"You get points by doing your job. By helping the operation run smoothly. By *not* taking food from coworkers." He let that last part hang in the air. "You lose points for fighting. For stealing. For making my life more difficult."

Guard-2's expression flickered—something between understanding and resentment.

"But..." Victor continued, "you can also earn bonus points by solving problems. Finding resources. Coming up with ideas that help everyone."

The resentment faded. This was interesting.

Victor dismissed the meeting.

Within hours, the Merit System transformed the dungeon.

Goblins who had previously done the minimum suddenly discovered enthusiasm. The mushroom patches on Floor Two were cleaned and organized with something approaching care. The mining operation on Floor Three—previously a chaotic mess of random digging—developed actual patterns.

Sniv tracked everything on a flat rock, scratching tally marks with obsessive precision. He had created a primitive spreadsheet: goblin designation on one axis, point totals on the other.

"Sniv likes this," he told Victor, studying his creation. "Sniv can see who works. Who doesn't work. Can tell Boss."

"That's the idea."

"Guard-2 brought back extra ration to Labor-15." Sniv's tone held something like wonder. "Said was 'mistake.' Wanted points fixed."

*Incentive structures. They work on goblins just like they work on executives.*

Victor looked at Sniv—really looked. The goblin seemed... different. He stood straighter. His voice carried more clearly. The chronic hunch of malnutrition had begun to fade.

"Sniv," Victor said. "You look taller."

The small goblin blinked, then glanced down at himself. "Sniv feels... stronger. Is because of points?"

"It's because you're not starving anymore. Regular food, regular work, regular rest. Your body is healing."

> **[ARMI - PERSONNEL ALERT]**
> Subject: Sniv (Employee #001)
> Observation: Physical development accelerating
> Metrics: Height +2cm, Muscle density +15%, Cognitive function +20%
> Evolution Progress: 18%
> Projection: Hobgoblin transformation within 30-45 days
> Note: First recorded case of managed goblin evolution via nutrition.

Sniv puffed up with pride. "Sniv is getting stronger because Sniv is good worker?"

"Something like that."

"Then Sniv will work harder. Sniv will be strongest."

*Careful what you wish for, little one. Strength comes with expectations.*

---

By evening, the operation had expanded to three floors.

Floor Two became dedicated to food production. Two goblin teams worked the mushroom patches in rotating shifts, ensuring continuous harvest. A third team had discovered a water source—a trickle from the rock face that they channeled into a crude basin.

Floor Three was now Mining Operations. The copper deposits Victor had noted earlier were being extracted with sharpened sticks and enthusiasm. Not efficient, but they had labor to spare.

Floor One remained Command—the Boss Chamber, storage, sleeping quarters for senior staff.

It was beginning to look less like a dungeon and more like... an operation.

*Optimal organizational structure minimizes friction, which maximizes output. Increased output generates surplus value. And in this market, surplus value is the only currency of survival.*

Victor was reviewing the day's resource reports—Sniv's scratched tallies, translated into actual numbers—when a commotion echoed from the stairs.

Mining Team 2 scrambled into the chamber, one of them clutching something dark and heavy.

"Boss! Boss! Found thing! Important thing!"

Victor took the object. Not copper. The color was wrong—darker, denser.

Iron ore.

"Where did you find this?"

"Floor Three. Deep corner. There's more—lots more." The goblin's eyes were wide. "But also... dead man."

---

Victor descended to Floor Three with Sniv and two guards.

The mining operation had expanded into a natural alcove. The walls here were darker, the air colder. Something about the space felt old.

The iron vein was substantial—easily thirty meters of exposed ore, waiting to be extracted. With proper tools, this could transform their capabilities.

But that wasn't what drew Victor's attention.

In the corner of the alcove, slumped against the wall, was a skeleton.

Human. Adult male, based on the bone structure. The remains of rusted armor clung to the ribcage—quality work, once. Silver inlay. Professional craftsmanship.

In the skeleton's bony grip was a scroll, protected by a leather case that had mostly survived the decades.

Victor pried it free and opened it carefully.

The text was faded but legible. ARMI provided translation:

> **[ARMI - DOCUMENT ANALYSIS]**
> Origin: Unknown (Pre-System Era)
> Age: Approximately 50 years
> Content: Personal message / Warning
> Translator's Note: Subject's handwriting indicates stress.

*"If you read this, I have failed.*

*My party entered this dungeon seeking glory and the bounty posted for the creature below. We were fools. The beast on Floor Four cannot be killed by mortal weapons. We wounded it, yes—but it healed faster than we could strike.*

*Marcus fell first. Then Elena. Then Sven.*

*I retreated here to bind my wounds, but the blood loss is too great. I will not survive the climb back.*

*To whoever finds this: Do not go below Floor Three. The Minotaur is ancient. It is patient. And it is waiting.*

*Signed, Sir Kael of the Silver Dawn*

*May the gods have mercy on anyone who follows."*

Victor lowered the scroll.

He looked at the stairs leading down—deeper into the dungeon, toward Floor Four. Toward Asterion.

Sir Kael of the Silver Dawn. A professional adventurer with a trained party, proper equipment, and whatever magic had existed fifty years ago.

He had died in a corner, alone, leaving a warning that no one had found until now.

"Boss?" Sniv's voice was small. "What does paper say?"

Victor folded the scroll carefully.

"It says the neighbors are more dangerous than we thought."
