# Chapter 95: The Delivery

Twelve hours.

Victor watched the Exchange hologram from his office as sixty-two miracles moved across dimensional space.

Each miracle: A glowing thread on the tactical map.

Each thread: A caravan route, a Waypoint transfer, a dimensional courier.

> **[ARMI - Operation Dashboard]**
> **Active Deliveries:** 62 miracles
> **Suppliers:** 9 vendors (8 worlds)
> **Destinations:** 12 Coalition estates
> **Timeline:** Staggered (0-12 hours)
> **Church Interception Risk:** 47% → 23% (decoy strategy active)

Victor had learned from last time.

Three fake caravans rolling south on visible highways—marked with Guild banners, guarded by mercenaries, carrying empty crates labeled "Agricultural Equipment."

Church patrols would intercept those first.

The real deliveries? Dimensional transfers. Untraceable. Instant.

Voros stood beside him, monitoring Guild logistics. "First batch materializing in... ninety seconds."

Victor pulled up the scrying orb interface. Focused on Lady Cassia's estate.

***

**Lady Cassia's Estate - Southern Borderlands**

The vault room was sealed. Guards posted. Cassia herself stood before an empty pedestal, hands clasped, eyes closed.

Praying.

Not to the Church.

To… whoever might be listening.

A blue shimmer appeared mid-air.

Five crystalline artifacts materialized—hovering, glowing, radiating divine mana.

> **[Miracle: Rain]** ×3
> **[Blessing: Fertile Soil]** ×2

They lowered gently onto cushions.

Cassia's eyes opened.

She reached out—hand trembling—and touched the nearest miracle.

Warm. Real. Divine.

She activated [Miracle: Rain].

***

Victor watched through the scrying orb as the sky above Cassia's estate darkened.

Clouds formed from nothing.

Rain fell.

Not a drizzle. A downpour.

Fields that had been cracked, brown, and dead for seven months began absorbing water within seconds. Peasants in the distance dropped their tools, looked up, and **screamed**—joy, disbelief, relief.

One old woman fell to her knees, sobbing.

A child ran through the rain, laughing.

Cassia stood in her manor window, watching.

Her lips moved. Victor couldn't hear the words.

But ARMI's lip-reading algorithm translated:

"Thank you."

Victor leaned back in his chair.

Didn't respond.

Couldn't, even if he wanted to—she was talking to the rain, not to him.

Asterion's voice cut through his thoughts. "Victor. You just saved an estate."

"I delivered a product," Victor said automatically. "The estate paid. Transaction complete."

But his voice sounded hollow.

Nova's light pulsed from the Core Chamber—sensing the same thing Asterion had.

Victor ignored them both.

Checked the delivery log.

> **[Estate 1 - Lady Cassia]:** COMPLETE (3 Rain, 2 Soil)
> **[Estate 2 - Lord Marrick]:** COMPLETE (4 Rain, 1 Water Purification)
> **[Estate 3 - Baroness Elira]:** IN PROGRESS (ETA: 8 minutes)

Nine more estates. Fifty-two miracles remaining.

The operation was working.

***

**Six Hours Later**

> **[Coalition Delivery Status]**
> **Completed:** 11 of 12 estates  
> **Miracles Delivered:** 57 of 62
> **Church Interceptions:** 0
> **Decoy Caravans Intercepted:** 3 (as planned)

Voros checked the logistics network. "Final delivery to Lord Kav's estate in twenty minutes. Then we're done."

Victor nodded. Watched the last thread on the map.

Five miracles. Dimensional transfer. Clean route.

Then a notification flared.

> **[ALERT - DIMENSIONAL INTERFERENCE DETECTED]**
> **Location:** Lord Kav's Estate, Grid 52-S
> **Source:** DIVINE COUNTERMEASURE (Church-sanctioned disruption field)

Victor's pulse spiked. "They blocked the transfer?"

Voros checked Guild intelligence. "Lord Kav's estate is under Church occupation. Inquisitor-General Matthias arrived three hours ago. He installed anti-dimensional wards."

"Can we route around it?"

"Not without physical delivery. And physical delivery means crossing Church checkpoints."

Victor pulled up the map. Lord Kav's estate was surrounded—four paladin platoons, divine wards, and Matthias himself.

Level 28. Divine Executioner.

> **[ARMI - Threat Analysis]**
> **Inquisitor-General Matthias:** Level 28
> **Escort:** 40+ paladins (Level 15-20)
> **Win Probability (Direct Confrontation):** 0.8%
> **Win Probability (Negotiation):** UNKNOWN

"Can we abort the final delivery?" Victor asked.

Voros shook his head. "Lord Kav is Coalition vote leader. If he doesn't receive miracles, he flips to Church. Coalition fractures. Eleven estates lose protection."

Victor stared at the map.

Eleven estates saved. One blocked.

Logical decision: Cut losses. Deliver to eleven. Accept 91.8% success rate.

But the Coalition didn't work on percentages. It worked on unity.

One estate lost = entire rebellion collapsed.

Victor opened a communication channel to Lord Kav's estate.

A voice answered—old, tired, defiant.

"This is Lord Daveth Kav. Who's calling?"

"The man with your miracles," Victor said. "Dimensional transfer is blocked. Do you have an alternate delivery point outside Church wards?"

"No. Matthias sealed the entire estate. No one in, no one out."

"What about underground? Smuggler tunnels?"

"Collapsed two days ago. Matthias is thorough."

Victor checked ARMI's structural analysis. The estate was air-tight.

"Then I can't deliver."

Kav's voice hardened. "Then the Coalition surrenders at dawn. Matthias wins."

"Not my problem."

"It is if you want payment," Kav said. "Contract specifies all twelve estates or no payment. You deliver eleven? You get nothing."

Victor froze.

Opened the Coalition contract.

Clause 14.3: **All-or-Nothing Delivery Terms.**

Voros winced. "I... may have missed that clause."

Victor's jaw tightened.

460,000 GP in miracles already delivered. Zero payment if the twelfth estate failed.

This wasn't a contract. It was a **hostage negotiation**.

"Lord Kav," Victor said slowly. "You're telling me the Coalition structured this contract to force me into confronting the Church's best Inquisitor?"

"I'm telling you we're desperate," Kav said. "You're our only option. So either you find a way to deliver, or we all lose."

Victor closed the channel.

Looked at Voros. At Asterion. At Nova's pulsing light.

"I can deliver," Asterion said. "Physically. I'll break through the wards."

"You'd die," Victor said.

"Acceptable risk."

"No." Victor pulled up the Exchange. Searched: **Ward-breaking Items.**

Results: Twelve options. Cheapest: 85,000 GP.

He didn't have that.

> **[Current Balance]:** 32,030 GP (after supplier payments)

Not enough to buy a ward-breaker.

Not enough to bribe paladins.

Not enough to hire a Level 28 counter-assassin.

He was **out of options**.

***

Then Hestia's avatar appeared.

"Victor. I've been monitoring. You're about to do something stupid."

"I'm about to lose half a million gold," Victor said. "Define 'stupid.'"

"Confronting Matthias directly."

"I'm not. I'm finding a third option."

"There isn't one."

Victor stood. "Then I'll create one."

He opened a new Exchange search: **Divine Audience Tokens.**

> **[Divine Audience Token - Terra-Insolvia]**
> **Cost:** 50,000 GP
> **Function:** Request formal audience with planetary deity (85% acceptance rate)
> **Cooldown:** One per user (permanent)

Victor stared at it.

50,000 GP he didn't have.

But...

He pulled up his asset inventory.

> **[Dungeon Core Fragment]** (purchased in Ch 93): Resale value 45,000 GP

Close. Not enough.

He checked the Gilded Caravan's asset registry.

> **[Barnaby's Commission Share]** (2% of all transactions): Current value 8,200 GP

Still short.

Then he saw it.

> **[Kade's Company - Employment Contract]**  
> **Remaining Contract Value:** 18,000 GP (29 days service owed)
> **Market Resale:** 12,000 GP (discounted for time-limited contract)

Victor could liquidate the contract. Sell Kade's remaining service to another buyer.

That would give him: 45,000 + 8,200 + 12,000 = **65,200 GP**.

Enough to buy the token.

Plus... enough to bribe Matthias's paladins? No. Level 20 paladins didn't take bribes.

But he could offer something better.

Victor pulled up ARMI's analysis of Matthias.

> **Inquisitor-General Matthias:**
> **Motivation:** Uphold Church authority
> **Weakness:** Institutional loyalty (follows Church doctrine rigidly)

What if Victor didn't fight Matthias?

What if he **recruited** him?

***

Victor activated the communication crystal. Direct line to Lord Kav's estate.

Matthias answered.

"This is Inquisitor-General Matthias. Identify yourself."

"Victor Kaine. The miracle broker you're hunting."

Silence.

Then: "You admit to heresy?"

"I admit to commerce," Victor said. "And I'm calling to negotiate."

"The Church does not negotiate with heretics."

"Then let me speak to your **employer**."

"I serve the Church of Eternal Light—"

"No," Victor interrupted. "You serve the *gods* the Church represents. And I can arrange a meeting. Directly. No intermediaries."

Victor purchased the [Divine Audience Token].

> **[Assets Liquidated]**
> - Dungeon Core Fragment: -45,000 GP
> - Barnaby's Commission: -8,200 GP
> - Kade's Contract Remainder: -12,000 GP
> **Token Acquired:** [Divine Audience - Terra-Insolvia]

He activated it.

The world... **shifted**.

Victor's consciousness pulled from his office, through dimensional layers, into a space of pure white light.

A voice spoke—vast, ancient, bemused.

**"WELL. THIS IS IRREGULAR."**

Victor didn't kneel. Didn't bow.

"I paid 50,000 gold for this meeting. I expect value."

The voice laughed.

**"YOU ARE THE ARBITRAGE MERCHANT. THE ONE UNDERMINING MY CHURCH."**

"I'm the one **filling the gap** your Church created," Victor corrected. "Your blessings are failing. Sixty-five percent success rate. That's not heresy—that's market inefficiency."

**"BECAUSE FAITH IS DECLINING. FEWER BELIEVERS. LESS DIVINE ENERGY."**

"Then the Church's monopoly is killing you," Victor said. "You can't scale faith when the Church charges 120,000 GP per blessing. I can."

**"YOU PROPOSE... WHAT? PARTNERSHIP?"**

"I propose you tell Matthias to let my final delivery through. In exchange, I'll broker miracles **through** the Church. Thirty percent commission. Church gets credit. Faith increases. You get more divine energy. Everyone wins."

Silence.

Then:

**"INQUISITOR MATTHIAS WILL RECEIVE... GUIDANCE."**

The light faded.

Victor snapped back to his office.

***

Two minutes later, Voros's communication crystal flared.

"Victor! The wards around Kav's estate just **dropped**. Matthias withdrew his paladins. He's... leaving."

Victor exhaled.

"Execute final delivery."

The five miracles materialized in Lord Kav's vault.

> **[Coalition Delivery: COMPLETE]**
> **12 of 12 Estates:** Delivered (100%)
> **Total Miracles:** 62
> **Contract Status:** FULFILLED

Payment arrived.

> **[Transaction Complete]**
> **Coalition Payment:** 540,000 GP
> **Supplier Costs:** -468,000 GP
> **Guild Fees (20%):** -54,000 GP
> **Net Revenue:** 18,000 GP

Victor stared at the number.

18,000 GP.

After liquidating 65,000 GP in assets to buy the Divine Audience Token.

Net loss: **-47,000 GP**.

Asterion walked in. "Victor. You just... negotiated with a god?"

"I negotiated with a failing business partner," Victor said. "Same thing."

"And you **lost money** on the Coalition contract."

"I lost money on the delivery," Victor corrected. "But I gained a Church partnership. That's infrastructure."

A new message appeared—from High Priestess Aurelia.

> Victor Kaine,
>
> Inquisitor-General Matthias reported your... conversation. The Church is willing to discuss terms.
>
> Sunspire Cathedral. Tomorrow. Noon.
>
> Come alone.

> **[ARMI - Strategic Status Update]**
> **Coalition Delivery:** SUCCESS (rebellion secured)
> **Church Negotiation:** OPENED (partnership possible)
> **G.A.C. Audit:** 56 hours remaining (legal documents prepared)
> **Consortium Deadline:** 26 days remaining, 879,970 GP needed
> **Current Balance:** -15,000 GP (DEBT)

Victor closed the message.

Looked at the deficit in his ledger.

Then at the Church summons.

"Sniv," he called.

The goblin appeared. "Yes, Boss?"

"Pack a formal negotiation kit. We're going to a cathedral."

"Sniv... meets gods?"

"No. We're **auditing** them."
