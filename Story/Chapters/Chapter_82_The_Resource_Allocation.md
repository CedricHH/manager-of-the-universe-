# Chapter 82: The Resource Allocation

The office on the third tier of the Bureau of Imperial Audit was a masterpiece of clinical minimalism. It wasn't designed to be comfortable; it was designed to be transparent. 

The walls were made of magically reinforced glass that overlooked the vertical sprawl of Aethelgard. From here, the city looked like a gears-of-war mechanism, a clockwork beast that breathed gold and exhaled smoke. The center of the room was dominated by a desk carved from a single block of white quartz, its surface so smooth it felt like ice under Victor’s palm.

Victor set his leather briefcase on the quartz. The click of the latches echoed in the silent room.

"The previous occupant was Senior Partner Jaxon," Thaddeus Vane said, standing by the doorway. "He was... retired following a discrepancy in the Western Harvest Audit. He left his furniture. He didn't have time to pack."

"The desk is adequate," Victor said, his eyes scanning the room for hidden surveillance. "Empty the floating cabinets. I want nothing left of 'Jaxon' in my workspace. A cluttered database is a compromised database."

Vane gave a short, approving nod. He snapped his fingers, and a group of clockwork drones—tiny, six-legged brass spiders—scurried across the floor. They moved with a high-pitched whirring sound, their mechanical limbs sweeping the floating scrolls and storage crystals into a disposal chute.

"Now," Vane said, his voice dropping to a more business-like tone. "Resources. You have five hundred thousand gold pieces in operational capital, but you lack feet on the ground. Project Valoria is too large for one man, even one of your... unique caliber."

Vane gestured to a crystalline screen on the wall. It flickered to life, showing a row of young men and women in various states of academic and professional dress.

"The Bureau’s Junior Analyst pool," Vane stated. "Mages who failed the combat tests but excelled in fiscal theory. Clerks from the Merchant Guild who sought more... stability. You may select two."

Victor walked to the screen, his gaze moving methodically from face to face. He didn't look at their magical aptitude or their noble connections. He tapped the ARMI interface on his wrist, syncing it with the Bureau’s database.

"This one," Victor said, pointing to a woman with short-cropped black hair and eyes that looked like they hadn't seen sleep in a month. "Mina. Her record shows she was flagged for 'excessive pedantry' during the grain audits."

"She challenged a Senior Partner's math," Vane noted. "Bold. Or foolish."

"It’s called quality control," Victor corrected. "I don't hire for boldness. I hire for accuracy. Who is the second?"

He bypassed several high-ranked nobles and stopped at a man with a slight tremor in his hands and a suit that was two seasons out of date.

"Silas," Victor said. "Formerly of the Gilded Ledger. He was downsized when the bank automated its clerical department."

"He was a redundancy," Vane said, raising an eyebrow.

"He was the only clerk who noticed the sub-prime loan bubble before it burst," Victor counter-argued. "His superiors fired him for 'negativity.' In my world, we call that a Risk Analyst."

Victor tapped the screen, finalizing the selection.

The office door slid open thirty minutes later. Mina and Silas entered, looking like survivors of a natural disaster who had been told they were being transferred to a high-security prison.

"I am Victor Kaine," Victor said, not looking up from the quartz desk. "I am your Senior Partner for Project Valoria. You have five minutes to memorize the non-disclosure agreements and three minutes to sit down. If you are still standing at the end of the eighth minute, your employment is terminated."

Mina didn't even blink. She grabbed a quill, signed the glowing scroll on the edge of the desk, and took a seat. Silas hesitated for exactly two seconds before following her lead, his hands still trembling slightly as he adjusted his iron-rimmed spectacles.

"Good," Victor said. "Speed is a secondary metric, but it indicates a lack of cognitive friction. Let’s look at—"

The office door slid open with a soundless hiss. It wasn't the functional, heavy slide of a standard Bureau door, but a rhythmic, artificial glide. 

A woman stepped into the light. She was tall, radiant, and wearing a suit of white silk that shimmered with an iridescent weave. Her hair was a shock of silver-gold, tied back in a professional bun that looked as sharp as a dagger. Unlike Vane’s cold grey, her presence felt warm—oppressively warm, like the air before a lightning strike. 

"Oh, Thaddeus," she said, her voice like honeyed silk. "You didn't tell me our new acquisition was so... tidy. Senior Partner Jaxon’s desk was always covered in stains. Ink and bourbon, mostly."

Vane stiffened. "Senior Partner Hestia. I wasn't aware you were conducting a site visit."

"I’m always conducting a visit, Thaddeus. Evaluation is the soul of the Bureau, isn't it?" Hestia walked toward Victor’s desk, her eyes—a startling, metallic silver—scanning the quartz surface. She stopped inches from Victor, the scent of expensive jasmine and ozone following her like a cloud. 

She looked down at Mina and Silas. Her smile didn't reach her eyes. 

"I remember you two," she said. "The 'Pedantic' and the 'Pessimist.' An interesting choice for a man who claims to be an efficiency expert. Tell me, Mr. Kaine, do you always collect the Bureau’s cast-offs?"

Victor didn't stand. He didn't even look up from the report he was reading. "I don't see cast-offs, Hestia. I see specialized tools that were being misused by generalists. Pedantry is just a word for 'zero-tolerance for error.' Pessimism is just a word for 'unbiased risk assessment.' If you were as efficient as you claim, you would have seen their value before I did."

Hestia’s smile widened, but the temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. "A sharp tongue. Very Oakhaven. But keep in mind, Mr. Kaine: Valoria is a poisoned asset. Three Senior Partners have tried to audit those mines and failed. One is in a debtor's prison, one is 'retired,' and the third is... well, Jaxon left you the desk."

She leaned over the quartz, her face inches from Victor's. "I'm offering you a professional courtesy. Walk away from the Grey Spires now. I’ll give you a ten percent finder’s fee for any initial data you've gathered, and I’ll transfer you to the Naval Shipyards. It’s safer. It’s cleaner. And the profit margins are predictable."

"Predictability is for people who can't manage volatility," Victor said, finally looking her in the eye. "And I don't accept finders' fees. I accept controlling interests. Unless you have a fiscal reason for being here, I have quills that need sharpening."

Hestia let out a soft, tinkling laugh that sounded like breaking glass. "Then I look forward to the quarterly reconciliation, Mr. Kaine. Just remember: in Aethelgard, we don't just audit the numbers. We audit the auditor."

She turned and glided out of the room, leaving the scent of jasmine and a palpable sense of threat hanging in the air. 

"She’s going to l-liquidate us," Silas whispered, his face now a shade of sickly grey. 

"Only if our numbers are soft," Victor said, his tone as cold as the quartz. "Mina, Silas. Back to the files. We have three days to find a way to short-sell the Onyx Syndicate."

He tapped the quartz surface. A holographic projection of the Grey Spires mine bloomed into the air, filling the room with a jagged, violet glow. Graphs and tables of ore production spun around them like a digital blizzard.

"Governor Malphas reports ten thousand tons of iron ore a month," Mina stated, her voice returning to its default state of flat professionalism. "It’s been ten thousand tons for thirty-six months. It’s a perfect horizontal line."

"Which means it's a lie," Silas added, his voice thin but steady as he focused on the moving data. "Mining doesn't scale like that. The mortality rate in the deep shafts should have caused a dip in the winter of 814. He’s hiding the labor shortages. Or perhaps he's hiding the fact that he's no longer digging for ore in the regulated zones."

"He's hiding more than that," Victor said. He leaned forward, his [Deep-Data Audit] skill pulsing through the ARMI interface.

"Mina," Victor commanded. "Cross-reference the Governor's personal wealth with any out-of-province transfers. Silas, look for 'Security Consultancies' in the Southern Free Cities. I want to know where the missing ore is going."

The room became a blur of activity. The scratch of quills and the hum of mana-data filling the silence. Victor watched them work, his mind already three steps ahead. He wasn't just looking for theft; he was looking for a lever.

"Sir," Mina suddenly said. She sounded... impressed. Or perhaps horrified. "I’ve found the 'Security Consultancies.' They’re not consultants. They’re debt collectors."

She slid a file across the desk. It was marked with the seal of the **Onyx Syndicate**, the primary banking power of the Southern Free Cities.

"Governor Malphas didn't just skim the ore," Silas whispered, his face pale. "He took out massive interest-only loans to fund his lifestyle. He used the future production of the Grey Spires as collateral."

Victor’s eyes scanned the document. "And look at Clause 44-B. In the event of a management transition—even an Imperial one—the Onyx Syndicate has the right to 'Accelerate the Debt'."

"Accelerate?" Mina asked. 

"They can demand the full balance immediately," Victor said. "And if the Duchy can't pay—which it can't—they have the right to foreclose on the land rights. Not just the mine. The entire province."

Victor stood up and walked to the glass wall. Below him, the lights of Aethelgard shimmered with a cold, uncaring brilliance.

"If the Emperor fires the Duke for corruption," Victor noted, "the Empire loses the province to a foreign bank. The Duke has created a suicide pact. He’s made himself 'Too Big To Fail'."

> Risk: High-Level Territorial Conflict.

"He think’s he’s safe because his failure would be too expensive for the Empire to handle," Victor whispered, his reflection in the glass a silhouette of clinical resolve.

"What do we do, sir?" Silas asked, his hands trembling again. "If we report this, the High Council will have to negotiate with the Syndicate. They’ll lose billions in silver rights."

Victor adjusted his silk tie. He didn't look like a man facing a geopolitical crisis. He looked like a man who had just found a massive, undervalued asset in a fire sale.

"We don't negotiate with debt collectors, Silas," Victor said, turning back to the desk. "We buy the collector. Mina, get me the list of the Onyx Syndicate’s own creditors. Let’s see who *they* owe money to."

The cliffhanger hung in the air: Victor Kaine wasn't just auditing a corrupt Duke. He was preparing to short-sell an entire banking syndicate. 

"The Grey Spires aren't just a mine anymore," Victor said, his eyes glowing with the blue light of the ARMI interface. "They're the collateral for a hostile takeover of the South."

Final Line: "Welcome to the real audit. Start with the fine print."
