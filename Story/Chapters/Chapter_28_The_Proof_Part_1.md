# Chapter 28: The Proof (Part 1)

The alert came at dawn.

> **[ARMI - PERIMETER ALERT]**
> Breach Detected: Main Entrance
> Entity Count: 4
> Classification: Adventurer Party (B-Rank)
> Threat Level: Moderate
> Estimated Combat Power: 65
> ETA to Floor 1: 12 minutes

Victor studied the Core's sensor display, watching four figures emerge from the forest path. Better equipped than the Silver Lance. More coordinated in their movements. Professional.

"Sniv," Victor said. "Status report."

The goblin materialized beside him, clipboard clutched in his clawed hands. "Traps reset, Boss. Krog team in position. Zip finish new smoke bombs yesterday. Asterion..." Sniv hesitated. "Asterion still reading contract."

"Still?"

"He like dental section. Read three times."

Victor filed that away. Employee satisfaction metrics were always useful.

He turned his attention to the approaching party, pulling up more detailed analysis through his connection with the Core.

> **[ARMI - PARTY ANALYSIS: Iron Wolves (B-Rank)]**
> - Gareth (Leader): Swordsman, Level 14. Aggressive combat style. Arrogance metrics: High.
> - Mira (Support): Mage, Level 13. Cautious, analytical. Threat assessment: Highest.
> - Bron (Tank): Defender, Level 15. Professional, minimal engagement. Reliable.
> - Tessa (DPS): Rogue, Level 11. Recent promotion. First B-Rank dungeon. Nervous.

Four adventurers. Combined threat level higher than the Silver Lance. But also higher revenue potential.

Victor calculated quickly. Previous dungeon average: 15 GP per party from loot drops and equipment recovery. Target for Core proof: 22.5 GP minimum. Bonus threshold: 30 GP.

One party. One chance. Prove the model or lose the partnership.

"This is our demonstration," Victor said quietly. "Everything we've built leads to this moment."

Sniv nodded, understanding the gravity even if he didn't understand the mathematics.

Then Victor's eyes caught something in the display. Mira the Mage, studying the corridor before advancing. The way she analyzed the environment. The caution. The intelligence.

*She reminds you of someone.*

The thought came unbidden, unlocking something Victor had kept buried for months.

---

*Six months after the betrayal.*

*Victor's apartment was expensive. Luxury fixtures, floor-to-ceiling windows, a wine collection worth more than most people's annual salary. Penthouse living for a man who had clawed his way up from nothing—first in his family to graduate college, first to make partner, first to sit on an executive board.*

*Now he sat in darkness with empty whiskey bottles scattered across the coffee table like casualties of a particularly brutal merger.*

*He read articles on his tablet. The scandal that had destroyed him, packaged neatly for public consumption.*

*"Victor Kaine acted alone in the supply chain irregularities. The board had no knowledge of his actions."*

*The comments under each article were worse. People who had never met him, calling him monster. Calling him criminal. Calling for his imprisonment, his ruination, his death.*

*And the board—the same executives who had approved every decision, who had signed every document, who had celebrated every efficiency gain—were quoted expressing their "deep shock and disappointment."*

*Lies. All of it lies. But Victor was too tired to care. Too hollow to fight. He had been the scapegoat, and scapegoats didn't get redemption arcs.*

*Until the email.*

*Anonymous sender. Subject line: "You probably already know this."*

*He almost deleted it. Assumed it was hate mail, more abuse from strangers who had decided he was evil. But something about the phrasing—clinical, detached, almost professional—made him pause.*

*He opened it.*

*Photographs. High resolution, timestamped, geotagged. A mine in eastern Congo. Workers—if you could call children as young as eight "workers"—covered in dust and sweat. Tunnels that looked like they could collapse at any moment. Armed guards standing watch.*

*Invoices. Shipping manifests. Chain of custody documentation that led directly to factories in China, then to assembly plants in Southeast Asia, then to his company's supply network.*

*The materials. The "Conflict-Free" minerals his efficiency protocols had processed millions of. The rare earth elements that made the company's flagship products possible.*

*They weren't conflict-free. They never had been.*

*Victor scrolled through the evidence, his stomach churning. Forty-seven children had died in that mine over a three-year period. Tunnel collapses. Toxic exposure. "Accidents" that were really just inevitabilities when you forced small bodies into spaces designed for tools.*

*His optimizations had increased quotas. His pressure for better margins had pushed suppliers to cut labor costs—which meant cutting labor safety. His spreadsheets had treated "Rare Earth Metals: Input Cost" as a number to be minimized, never asking what that minimization cost in human terms.*

*Victor stared at the screen.*

*For the first time in his career, he asked the question he'd always avoided:*

*"Where did the numbers come from?"*

---

Victor blinked.

The Core's display showed the Iron Wolves advancing through Floor 1. Twelve minutes had become eight. He'd lost time—lost in memories he'd thought he'd buried along with his old life.

"Boss?" Sniv was watching him with concern. "Orders?"

Victor forced himself to focus. The present mattered now. The past was ash.

He pulled up the tactical overview. Four adventurers at various positions. Gareth in front, leading with aggressive confidence. Mira second, scanning for traps. Bron covering rear. Tessa somewhere in the middle, trying to look calm and failing.

The old way would be simpler. Four deaths meant equipment recovery, body loot, approximately 60 GP in value. Well above any target. The Core would be satisfied. Victor's partnership would be secured.

All he had to do was let them die.

But that wasn't the model he'd pitched. And somewhere deep, beneath the spreadsheets and the calculations, Victor remembered what it cost when numbers forgot they were people.

"No kills," Victor said. His voice was flat. Final. "We do this my way."

Sniv hesitated. "But Boss... if we fail—"

"We won't." Victor turned to face the tactical display fully. His mind was already running scenarios, calculating approach vectors, identifying psychological leverage points.

"Gareth is arrogant. Probably came up through the Guild's fast-track program—lots of success, not much failure. He'll take any bait that feeds his ego. Challenge him, and he'll charge in without thinking."

He pointed at Mira's indicator on the display.

"The mage is intelligent. She's already noticed the trap layout is unusual. She'll see value where others see threats—show her profit potential, not danger. Make her feel like she's discovering an opportunity."

"The tank follows orders; don't waste energy on him. He'll do whatever Gareth tells him, or whatever Mira convinces Gareth to do."

Victor's voice slowed as he reached the final member of the party.

"And the young one..."

Tessa. Level 11. First B-Rank dungeon. Nervous hands. Quick eyes. Reminded him of junior analysts at his old firm—bright, ambitious, too new to know how the game really worked.

Tessa. Level 11. First B-Rank dungeon. Nervous.

"The young one lives," Victor said. "That's non-negotiable."

Sniv didn't understand. Neither did Victor, entirely.

But somewhere deep, beneath the restructurer's cold logic, a dead man remembered photographs of children.

And refused to add to the count.
