# Chapter 96: The Cathedral

Debt.

Victor stared at the number in his ledger.

**Balance: -15,000 GP**

Negative. Red. Underwater.

> **[ARMI - Financial Status: CRITICAL]**
> **Debt:** -15,000 GP
> **Daily Operating Costs:** 450 GP (dungeon maintenance, employee salaries, Floor 5 operations)
> **Bankruptcy Timeline:** 33 days (assuming zero revenue)
> **Consortium Deadline:** 26 days remaining
> **Remaining Goal:** 879,970 GP
> **Recommendation:** IMMEDIATE CAPITAL INJECTION REQUIRED

Dawn light filtered through his office window. The Church summons lay on his desk: **Sunspire Cathedral. Noon. Come alone.**

Not a request. A command.

Victor didn't care about the tone. He cared about the **opportunity**.

The gods were desperate enough to negotiate. That meant leverage.

***

Sniv shuffled in, carrying what he proudly called a "formal negotiation kit."

It was Victor's least-worn coat, three blank contract templates, and an ARMI recording crystal.

"Boss ready for scary Church meeting?"

Victor took the coat. "Did you pack contingency documents?"

"Sniv packed... um... what contingency?"

"Asset transfer protocols. If the Church arrests me, ownership of the dungeon transfers to Nova. Voros gets power of attorney for external contracts. Asterion becomes interim administrator."

Sniv's ears flattened. "Boss thinks Church arrests Boss?"

"Eighty-two percent chance they don't," Victor said. "But I plan for the eighteen percent."

Asterion entered, arms crossed. "Victor. This is High Priestess Aurelia. She tried to shut down the dungeon in Chapter 61. She sent Matthias to crush a rebellion yesterday. She's not your ally."

"She doesn't need to be my ally," Victor said, fastening his coat. "She needs to be my **client**."

He opened the Galactic Exchange one last time before leaving.

Checked the market.

> **[Miracle: Rain]** - Current Price: 63,000 GP (↑ 40% from yesterday)
> **[Blessing: Fertile Soil]** - Current Price: 58,000 GP (↑ 35%)
> **[Market Analysis]:** DEMAND SURGE - Southern Coalition demonstrations created viral effect across 8 provinces

Victor stared at the numbers.

Yesterday, [Miracle: Rain] cost 45,000 GP.

Today: 63,000 GP.

Eighteen thousand gold price increase in twelve hours.

**Why?**

Because eleven Coalition estates activated rain miracles simultaneously yesterday. Peasants saw the storms. Crops absorbed water. Word spread.

Now **everyone** wanted miracles.

Victor hadn't just supplied a rebellion.

He'd **created a market**.

***

The Gilded Caravan rolled toward Sunspire Cathedral.

Three-hour journey. Barnaby drove. Kade's Company rode escort—forty-two sellswords Victor had re-hired for 3,000 GP (emergency loan from Voros, repayable Next week or never, depending on how the Church meeting went).

Sniv sat across from Victor, scribbling notes.

"Boss, what if Church lady says no deal?"

"Then I walk out," Victor said. "And continue independent operations."

"What if she says arrest?"

"Then Kade fights a delaying action while I escape via dimensional transfer."

"What if she says yes deal but bad terms?"

Victor smiled. "Then I negotiate better terms."

He pulled up ARMI's information map.

**What Aurelia Knows:**
- Victor sold miracles to Coalition (Matthias confirmed)
- Divine entity approved delivery (wards dropped per god's command)
- Victor has "connections to powers outside Church authority"

**What Aurelia Doesn't Know:**
- Galactic Exchange exists
- Victor sources from other worlds
- Victor is currently in **debt**

That last part was critical.

If Aurelia thought Victor was wealthy from the Coalition contract (540k GP gross), she'd negotiate from strength.

But Victor had **spent** that money on suppliers, fees, and divine audience tokens.

He looked rich. He was broke.

Perfect information asymmetry.

***

Sunspire Cathedral appeared on the horizon.

Massive. Seven golden spires piercing the sky. White stone walls radiating divine mana—visible shimmer in the air, like heat waves.

Paladins stationed every fifty meters.

No weapons allowed inside.

> **[ARMI - Location Scan]**
> **Sunspire Cathedral**
> **Security Level:** EXTREME
> **Personnel:** 72 paladins, 14 priests, 1 High Priestess (Level 26)
> **Divine Wards:** ACTIVE (detects: lies, dark magic, hostile intent)
> **Win Probability (Combat):** 0.02%
> **Assessment:** NEGOTIATION ENVIRONMENT ONLY

The caravan stopped at the outer gate.

Victor stepped out.

Looked at Kade. "If I'm not back in two hours, inform Voros."

"What does he do?"

"Executes contingency protocols."

Kade frowned. "Which are?"

"Assumes I'm dead. Liquidates assets. Pays debts. Distributes remainder to employees."

"You have a will?"

"I have **six**," Victor said. "Depends on how I die."

Kade stared. Victor didn't smile.

He walked toward the Cathedral entrance.

Sniv scurried after him.

***

The Third Sanctum was circular.

Stained glass windows depicted Church history: Paladins smiting demons. Priests blessing harvests. Inquisitors burning heretics.

Subtle.

A single marble table dominated the center. Ornate. Expensive. Designed to impress.

High Priestess Aurelia sat on one side.

Two empty chairs on the other.

**Aurelia** (Level 26, Divine Channeler):

Mid-forties. Silver hair bound in an elaborate braid. Golden vestments that probably cost more than Victor's entire dungeon. Eyes cold—calculation beneath religious facade.

Divine mana pulsed visibly around her. Intimidation tactic.

Victor wasn't intimidated.

He sat.

"Mr. Kaine," Aurelia said. "You come unarmed."

"I come to negotiate. Weapons would be counterproductive."

Her gaze shifted to Sniv. "And this... creature?"

"Sniv is notetaker!" the goblin squeaked.

"He's my assistant," Victor said. "All meetings are documented. Standard business practice."

Aurelia's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Of course. Please, sit."

Victor was already sitting.

She knew that.

This was posturing.

"You've caused significant disruption, Mr. Kaine," Aurelia said. "Twelve estates received unauthorized divine blessings. Intelligence suggests you're the source. Inquisitor-General Matthias believes you have... connections to powers outside Church authority."

"I have suppliers," Victor said. "Just as the Church has—had—divine connections."

Aurelia's expression hardened. "'Had'?"

"Your blessing success rate declined from ninety percent to sixty-five percent over seven months. That suggests supply constraints. Either your gods are losing faith in you, or believers are losing faith in your gods."

Dangerous ground.

Questioning divine power inside a cathedral could get you burned.

Sniv made a strangled sound.

Aurelia's hand **glowed**—divine energy warning. "You dare—"

"I dare state facts," Victor interrupted calmly. "You invited me here to negotiate, High Priestess. If you wanted to burn me for heresy, Matthias would've done it yesterday. So let's skip the posturing. What does the Church **actually** want?"

Silence.

The glow faded.

Aurelia leaned back. "The Church requires consistent miracle supply. The southern provinces are experiencing... unusual demand. We cannot produce sufficient blessings to meet it."

"Why?"

"That's confidential."

"Then I can't price a supply contract," Victor said. "If I don't know your production constraints, I don't know your desperation level."

Aurelia's jaw tightened. "This isn't desperation. This is **delegation**."

"Translation: outsourcing," Victor said. "Fine. Here's my offer."

He pulled a contract template from his coat. Slid it across the table.

"I source miracles via my supply chain. Church rebrands them as 'sanctified blessings.' Church handles distribution and customer relations. Revenue split: Sixty-forty."

Aurelia scanned the document. "Sixty percent to the Church?"

"Sixty percent to me. I'm the supplier. You're the distributor."

Her hand slammed the table.

Divine mana flared—not attacking, but **pressure**. The air grew heavy.

Sniv whimpered.

Victor didn't flinch.

"Unacceptable," Aurelia said coldly. "The Church of Eternal Light is the divine authority on this continent—"

"The Church is a **brand**," Victor interrupted. "A valuable brand, yes. Established trust. Legal authority. Distribution network. But without supply, your brand has nothing to sell."

"You suggest the Church is a... a **storefront**?"

"I suggest the Church is infrastructure," Victor said. "You have customer trust. I have product access. Together, we rebuild market share."

Aurelia stood—towering over the table. She rose to full height, nearly six feet in golden vestments that gleamed with embedded divine crystals. Divine mana crackled visibly around her hands.

"And if I refuse? If I declare you heretic and seize your assets?"

Victor met her gaze. "Then you get zero miracles. And the southern provinces continue buying from whoever can deliver. Within six months, a dozen independent brokers emerge. Your monopoly fragments permanently. Church revenue collapses. Faith declines faster."

He paused.

"Or, you accept reality: The miracle market changed. Adapt or become irrelevant."

> **[ARMI - Negotiation Analysis]**
> **Aurelia's Position:** Weak (declining production, market share erosion)
> **Victor's Position:** Weak (debt, Church can raid dungeon)
> **Mutual Dependency:** EXTREME
> **Optimal Outcome:** 50/50 partnership + protective clauses

Victor shifted. "Revised offer. Fifty-fifty split. Church handles customer-facing operations—marketing, distribution, quality assurance. I handle supply chain. We formalize this as a joint venture. I become 'Blessed Merchant of the Church.' Official title. Legal protection from Inquisitorial raids."

Aurelia considered.

"And your supply chain? Where do these miracles originate?"

"Proprietary. Trade secret. Non-negotiable."

"The Church requires transparency—"

"The Church requires **results**," Victor said. "I can deliver sixty miracles per week, guaranteed, at forty percent below your current production costs. Or you can demand transparency and get zero miracles while competitors take your market share."

"Competitors?" Aurelia's eyes narrowed. "You mean *you*."

"I mean **anyone**," Victor said. "Markets abhor vacuums. If the Church doesn't fill demand, someone else will. Better to partner with the supplier you know than fight the ten you don't."

Long pause.

Aurelia sat.

Pulled the contract closer. Read silently for ninety seconds.

Then she looked up.

"Provisional agreement. Thirty-day trial period. Fifty-fifty revenue split. You deliver miracles; Church distributes via sanctified channels. Miracles are rebranded as Church-authorized blessings. You receive legal protection as 'Blessed Merchant.' But—if you default on delivery, contract voids and all assets tied to this venture are forfeit to the Church."

"And if the Church defaults?" Victor asked.

Aurelia smiled coldly. "The Church never defaults."

Victor extended his hand. "Then we have a deal."

They shook.

> **[ARMI - Partnership Confirmed]**
> **Entity:** Church of Eternal Light (Joint Venture)
> **Terms:** 50/50 revenue split, 30-day trial, Church distribution network, Victor supply chain
> **Delivery Obligation:** 60 miracles/week minimum
> **Estimated Monthly Revenue:** 180,000 GP gross (90,000 GP Victor's share)
> **Legal Protection:** Inquisitorial Immunity (conditional)
> **Risk:** Asset forfeiture if delivery default

Victor stood. "I'll begin deliveries within forty-eight hours. First batch: Twenty miracles. Church can distribute via existing channels."

"Acceptable."

They walked toward the exit.

At the door, Aurelia paused.

"Mr. Kaine. One question."

"Yes?"

"Why partner with the Church? You could've continued independent operations. Built your own distribution."

Victor looked back. "Because the Church has something I need."

"Which is?"

"Legitimacy," Victor said. "Independent brokers get raided. Church partners get protected. I'm not interested in fighting Inquisitors. I'm interested in profit."

Aurelia almost smiled. "Pragmatic."

"Always."

***

Outside, Kade was pacing.

"Boss! You're alive!"

"Why wouldn't I be?"

"You just negotiated with the **High Priestess**. I thought—"

"You thought wrong," Victor said, climbing into the caravan. "Sniv. Notes?"

The goblin held up three pages of scribbled contracts. "Sniv documented everything!"

"Good. Send copies to Voros and Nova. Mark as 'Church Partnership - Operational.'"

The caravan started moving.

Victor opened ARMI.

Ran the numbers.

**Church Contract Analysis:**
- Revenue Potential: 90,000 GP/month (Victor's 50%)
- Consortium Goal: 879,970 GP remaining
- Timeline: 26 days
- **Problem**: 90k/month = ~2.3 months to reach goal
- **Actual Deadline**: 26 days

The Church contract solved **long-term** revenue.

But Victor needed **short-term** capital.

Ninety thousand gold per month meant nothing if he bankrupted in twenty-six days.

He needed another angle.

***

The caravan arrived at Oakhaven at dusk.

A message was waiting.

From Hestia.

> Victor,
>
> G.A.C. Compliance flagged your divine partnership.
>
> Consortium Policy, Section 12.7: Restructurers cannot form "dependency relationships" with local power structures. Partnership with planetary Church = policy violation.
>
> Audit **accelerated**. ETA: 24 hours.
>
> They're sending Auditor-Class enforcement.
>
> Recommendation: Dissolve Church contract OR provide evidence partnership serves Consortium interests.
>
> You have one day to decide.
>
> -H

Victor stared at the message.

Read it twice.

**The Problem**:
- Church contract = 90k GP/month (solves Consortium goal eventually)
- Church contract = policy violation (terminates Consortium contract immediately)
- **Paradox**: The solution is the violation

Sniv noticed. "Boss? What wrong?"

Victor's mind raced.

**Option A**: Dissolve Church partnership (lose revenue stream, lose legal protection)

**Option B**: Fight G.A.C. audit (prove partnership serves Consortium interests somehow)

**Option C**: Find loophole in Consortium policy Section 12.7

He opened ARMI.

Typed:

> **Request: Consortium Contract Interpretation - Partnership Clause 12.7 ("Dependency Relationships")**

ARMI processed.

> **[Searching Galactic Legal Database...]**
> **Complexity Level:** EXTREME
> **ETA:** Unknown (multi-source cross-reference required)
> **Preliminary Analysis:** "Dependency relationship" undefined in contract; subject to auditor discretion

No clear answer.

Which meant the audit would be **subjective**.

Victor closed the interface.

Looked at Sniv. "Get Nova, Voros, and Hestia on emergency channel. Conference in Core Chamber. Thirty minutes."

"What Boss planning?"

Victor stood.

Straightened his coat.

"We're about to audit the auditors."
