# Chapter 59: The Settlement

The silence in the lobby was absolute, broken only by the rhythmic *drip-drip-drip* of a Healing Potion leaking from a smashed crate.

Victor sat on an overturned pillar—the same one the Crimson Blades had tried to collapse earlier—and tapped his pen against a clipboard.

"Let's review the itemized bill," Victor said, his voice calm, echoing slightly in the wrecked chamber.

Across from him, the "Safety Inspection Team" was currently indisposed.

Kaelen, the proud leader, was bound in shadow-chains that pulsed with a dull purple light. His plate armor was dented in the shape of a Minotaur's fist.
Vara, the mage, was silenced by a gag made of sticky slime.
Bruk the Barbarian was unconscious, sleeping peacefully after Asterion had introduced him to the concept of 'concussive force.'
Torque the Rogue was glued to the wall by a Spider-Silk Trap.

Inspector Vorne stood in the center of the carnage. He was unbound, unhurt, and trembling with a rage that was almost impressive in its intensity.

"This is treason," Vorne hissed. "You attacked Royal Officers. You assaulted a Crown Inspector. I will have you executed, Kaine. I will have this entire hill leveled."

Victor didn't look up from his clipboard. "Correction. You initiated a 'Code Red Liquidation' without a warrant. My security team merely neutralized a hostile threat in self-defense. Clause 44 of the Kingdom Self-Defense Act: 'A property owner may use reasonable force to repel armed intruders.'"

"Reasonable?" Vorne gestured to Kaelen, who groaned as the shadow-chains tightened. "You broke his ribs!"

"He tried to behead me," Victor said. "I consider broken ribs a distinct discount on the price of his life."

He ripped the top sheet off the clipboard and held it out.

"Here is the Invoice for Damages. Structural repairs: 500 gold. Cleaning fees: 200 gold. Emotional distress for my goblin staff: 50 gold. Total: 750 gold."

Vorne laughed. It was a jagged, hysterical sound. "You think I'm paying you? After you... you kidnapped my team?"

"I don't expect *you* to pay," Victor said. "I expect the Adventurer Guild to pay. It will be listed under 'Training Expenses'."

"Training?"

Victor stood up. He walked over to Valerius, who was holding the recording crystal.

"Valerius, play the tape."

A hologram flickered to life. It showed the Crimson Blades attacking first. It showed Vara casting the Siege Spell. It showed Vorne shouting "Liquidate him!"

"This footage," Victor said softly, "is very damaging. If the Royal Court sees this, they will see a Guild Inspector ordering a hit on a tax-paying business owner just hours before the Crown Prince arrives. They might wonder... why? Was Vorne trying to hide something? Was he inciting a riot?"

Vorne’s face went pale. "You... you wouldn't."

"I would," Victor said. "Unless we reach a Settlement."

He pulled a second document from his jacket pocket. It was crisp, clean, and already stamped with Insolvia's seal.

"Terms," Victor said.

1. "The events of today were a 'High-Intensity Stress Test Simulation.' All injuries were part of the exercise."
2. "The Adventurer Guild issues a 'Certificate of Compliance' regarding Insolvia's safety standards, valid for six months."
3. "You pay the 750 gold invoice for the... 'Simulation Setup Costs'."

Vorne stared at the paper. "This is blackmail."

"This is business," Victor corrected. "You get to keep your job. Your team gets to keep their lives. I get a clean audit."

Vorne looked at Kaelen. The knight looked broken.
He looked at the hologram, still playing the moment he ordered the execution.
He looked at his pocket watch. *T-minus 4 hours to Royal Arrival.*

If this mess wasn't cleaned up... if the Prince saw this wreckage... Vorne would be executed for incompetence long before he could prosecute Victor.

Slowly, painfully, Vorne reached for the pen.

"I hate you," Vorne whispered.

"That's fine," Victor said. "Hatred is an emotion. Compliance is an action. Sign here."

Vorne signed.

**T-Minus 3 Hours**

"RELEASE THEM!" Victor shouted the moment the ink was dry.

The shadow chains vanished. The slime dissolved. The Crimson Blades slumped to the floor, groaning.

"Get them out," Victor ordered Asterion. "Throw them in a cart and dump them at the Guild Hall. Make sure they sign the release forms on the way out."

"It will be done, Boss." Asterion grabbed Kaelen by the back of his armor and dragged him like a sack of potatoes.

Victor turned to the lobby. It looked like a bomb had gone off. Because one had.

"LISTEN UP!" Victor’s voice amplified by magic, booming through the dungeon.

Hundreds of goblins, kobolds, and slimes poked their heads out of tunnels.

"We have three hours," Victor announced. "I want this place spotless. I want the blood scrubbed. I want the rubble moved. I want the scorched walls painted."

"Sniv!"

"Yes, Boss!" The goblin appeared, wearing a maid's outfit over his armor.

"Project Sparkle is a go. Mobilize the Sanitation Slimes. Get the Kobold Masons on the pillar. And for the love of the System, put some flowers in the vase by the door."

"Flowers!" Sniv saluted. "On it!"

The dungeon exploded into activity. It was chaotic, frantic, and beautiful.

Victor watched as a team of slimes dissolved a pile of broken masonry.
He watched as kobolds used earth magic to fuse the cracked floor tiles.
He watched as Valerius ran around with a clipboard, checking alignment on the 'Welcome' banners.

It wasn't just a monster den. It was a well-oiled machine.

Victor checked his reflection in a shard of glass. His suit was dusty. His tie was crooked.

"I need to change," he muttered. "Can't meet a Prince looking like a laborer."

***

**T-Minus 10 Minutes**

The lobby sparkled.
The floor shone with a fresh coat of wax.
The air smelled of lavender (to hide the scent of ozone and dried blood).
The goblins were hidden.
Asterion stood by the door in his ceremonial armor, looking like a statue of mythic power.

Victor stood at the center. He wore a midnight-blue coat with silver threading—understated, expensive, regal.

"They're coming," Asterion rumbled.

From outside, the sound of trumpets echoed off the valley walls. The heavy *clop-clop-clop* of royal horses approached.

Victor felt a pulse from the Dungeon Core. Anxiety? No. Anticipation.

The massive double doors swung open.

Sunlight flooded the lobby.

A carriage stopped. It was white and gold, emblazoned with the crest of the Kingdom of Valdris—a Lion holding a Sun.

Footmen in velvet liveries scrambled to open the door.

"Presenting," a herald announced, "His Royal Highness, Prince Aldric of Valdris!"

A boot touched the ground. Polished leather.
Then a leg in silk breeches.

Prince Aldric stepped out.

He was young. Maybe twenty. He had the golden hair of the royal line and a face that had never seen a day of hardship. He looked... soft. His eyes scanned the dungeon entrance with a mix of curiosity and boredom.

"So this is the place," Aldric said. His voice was light, almost musical. "Smaller than the reports said."

Victor stepped forward and bowed—deep enough to be respectful, shallow enough to show he was an equal.

"Your Highness," Victor said smoothly. "Quality is rarely measured in square footage. Welcome to Insolvia Holdings."

Aldric smiled. It was a charming, practiced smile. "And you must be the Manager. Mr. Kaine? I've heard fascinating things."

"I aim to please."

"Do you?" Aldric stepped closer. "My advisors tell me you are a threat to the economic stability of the realm. A rogue element."

"Innovation often looks like a threat to the established order," Victor parried.

Aldric laughed. "True. Very true."

Then he turned back to the carriage. "Aurelia? Come see. It's not a pit at all. It's quite... civilized."

A second figure emerged.

Victor’s internal alarms went off.

She wore the white-and-gold robes of the High Priestess. She was older than the Prince, perhaps thirty, with eyes that were cold, hard chips of blue ice. She held a staff topped with a sun-crystal that radiated pure, burning holy light.

**High Priestess Aurelia.**

She didn't smile. She didn't look bored.
She looked at the dungeon—and she looked at Victor—like she was spotting a stain on a white tablecloth.

"Civilization can be a mask for heresy, Your Highness," Aurelia said. Her voice was like a gavel striking stone.

She stepped into the lobby. As her foot touched the floor, the shadows in the corners seemed to hiss and recoil.

"I smell necromancy," Aurelia whispered. "And greed."

Victor kept his smile fixed, but his mind was racing.

*The Prince is the guest,* he realized. *The Priestess is the audit.*

> **[ARMI]**
> **New Entity Detected**: High Priestess Aurelia.
> **Threat Level**: EXTREME.
> **Affiliation**: Church of Eternal Light.
> **Objective**: Purge.

"Please," Victor gestured to the reception desk. "We have prepared refreshments. And I believe we have much to discuss regarding the... spiritual welfare of my employees."

Aldric clapped his hands. "Excellent! I'm starving. Do you have those little slime-cakes?"

Aurelia didn't move. She stared at Victor.

"We shall see," she said.

**Status**: The VIP has arrived. And he brought the Inquisition.
