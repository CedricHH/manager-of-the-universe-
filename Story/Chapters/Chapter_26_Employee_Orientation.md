# Chapter 26: Employee Orientation

The dungeon was his.

Victor stood in the Core Chamber, watching the crystal pulse with slow, rhythmic light. The administrative bond had been accepted. The functions had been unlocked. He was, by every metric that mattered, the official owner of this underground facility.

And yet.

> **[ARMI - ORGANIZATIONAL ALERT]**
> Warning: Organizational Structure Unstable
> Current Assets:
> - 26 Employees (Goblins: 25, Kobold: 1)
> - 1 Allied Entity (Asterion) - STATUS: NOT CONTRACTED
> - 1 Infrastructure (Dungeon Core-7749) - STATUS: PASSIVE MODE
> Recommendation: Formalize command hierarchy. Unstable alliances create liability.

Victor frowned at the notification. The system was right, of course. Asterion was currently classified as an "allied entity"—a polite way of saying "temporary arrangement that could collapse at any moment." The Minotaur had agreed to a provisional contract, but provisional contracts had expiration dates.

If Victor wanted guaranteed loyalty—the kind you could build an organization on—he needed paperwork.

"Sniv," Victor said.

The goblin materialized from somewhere in the shadows. His evolution was progressing well; the hobgoblin characteristics were becoming more pronounced with each passing day. Broader shoulders. Longer limbs. A marginally more intelligent gleam in his eyes.

"Boss?"

"Summon Asterion to the Core Chamber. Tell him it's... an HR matter."

Sniv's face scrunched in confusion. "H... R?"

"Human Resources. Or in this case, Monster Resources. Just tell him I want to discuss his future with the organization."

Asterion arrived twenty minutes later.

The Minotaur had to duck through the chamber entrance, his horns scraping the ancient stone. In the confined space of the Core Chamber, he seemed even larger than Victor remembered—eight feet of muscle, horn, and barely-contained violence.

"You summoned me, Manager." Asterion's voice rumbled like distant thunder. His eyes—ancient, wary—fixed on Victor with an intensity that made the goblin's survival instincts scream warnings.

Victor ignored them. Survival instincts were for people who didn't have leverage.

"I did." He held up a document—actual parchment, carefully prepared by Sniv's surprisingly neat handwriting. "Your current status in this organization is 'allied entity.' That's a temporary classification. Unstable. Subject to renegotiation at any time."

Asterion's eyes narrowed. "You wish to... renegotiate?"

"I wish to upgrade." Victor spread the document on a convenient stone surface. "I'm offering you a permanent position. Consider it a promotion from 'hired muscle' to 'executive staff.'"

The Minotaur approached slowly, his massive hooves echoing in the chamber. He looked down at the parchment with an expression Victor couldn't entirely read. Suspicion? Curiosity? Something else?

"Explain," Asterion said.

Victor pointed to the relevant sections. "Position: Chief Security Officer. You run all defensive operations. Training, deployment, threat assessment. Everyone in the security division reports to you."

"I already do this."

"You do it as a favor. This makes it official." Victor tapped the compensation section. "Base salary: ten gold pieces per week. Paid directly from dungeon revenue. Additionally—" He highlighted the benefits package. "—dental coverage. Your tusks are chipped; we'll get those repaired. Vision coverage, if you need reading assistance. And most importantly: respawn guarantee."

Asterion's head tilted. "Respawn guarantee?"

"If you die in the line of duty, I pay the mana cost to regenerate you through the Core. Standard dungeon resurrection protocol, but employer-funded." Victor's voice was matter-of-fact. "You're an asset worth protecting. This formalizes that protection."

The Minotaur was silent for a long moment. His massive hands—hands that had killed four hundred adventurers—trembled slightly as he studied the contract.

"In two hundred and forty-seven years," Asterion said slowly, "no one has ever offered me compensation. I was spawned to guard. To kill. To wait. The dungeon provided me with existence. Nothing more."

"That was poor management." Victor met the Minotaur's gaze without flinching. "I don't repeat others' mistakes. You're worth more than mere existence. This contract reflects that value."

Asterion looked at the dental line again.

"What is... 'dental'?"

"Tooth maintenance. Currently, your tusks show stress fractures from centuries of combat. That affects performance metrics." Victor shrugged. "Besides, healthy teeth improve morale. It's basic employee welfare."

The Minotaur made a sound that might have been laughter. Or might have been disbelief. Hard to tell with Minotaurs.

"You are strange, Manager."

"I'm effective. Sign the contract."

Asterion picked up the quill that Sniv had provided. For a moment, he simply held it—this massive creature, designed for violence, hesitating over a signature line like a nervous job applicant.

Then he signed.

The parchment glowed briefly as the binding took effect. Victor felt the connection through his ARMI interface—a new thread of loyalty, formalized and unbreakable.

> **[ARMI - CONTRACT BINDING]**
> New Employee Registered: Asterion
> Position: Chief Security Officer (CSO)
> Loyalty Classification: CONTRACTUAL (Binding)
> Compensation: 10 GP/week + Benefits Package
> Status: ACTIVE

"Welcome to the team," Victor said. "Your first task: report for orientation."

Asterion blinked. "Orientation?"

"You'll need to understand the updated organizational structure. Sniv!"

The goblin reappeared, carrying a large piece of slate with chalk markings. Victor had spent three hours the previous night designing this, and he was rather proud of the result.

---

The full staff assembled in what Victor had designated the "conference chamber"—a wide section of Floor Three that could accommodate Asterion's bulk without cramping.

Twenty-six goblins. One Kobold. One Minotaur. One goblin-shaped restructurer. All staring at a crude but legible organizational chart.

"This," Victor announced, "is who we are now."

```
VICTOR KAINE (CEO / Administrator)
        ↓
DUNGEON CORE-7749 (Infrastructure)
        ↓
├── ASTERION (CSO) - Security Division
│   └── Krog (Guard Team Lead)
│       └── [5 Guard Goblins]
│
├── SNIV (COO) - Operations Division
│   └── [15 Worker Goblins]
│
└── ZIP (CTO) - R&D Division
    └── [Workshop - Solo]
```

The goblins stared with expressions ranging from confusion to terror. Sniv beamed with pride, clearly understanding enough to know he was important. Asterion studied the chart like a philosopher confronting an unfamiliar theorem.

Zip raised a claw. "What is... C...T...O?"

"Chief Technology Officer. You run Research and Development. All trap design, engineering projects, and innovation initiatives report to you."

The Kobold's eyes widened. "Zip is... *chief*?"

"You're the only qualified candidate." Victor turned to address the full assembly. "This is Phase 1 of our reorganization. Clear lines of authority. Defined responsibilities. Everyone knows their role, everyone knows their chain of command."

"What Phase 2, Boss?" Sniv asked.

Victor looked at the ceiling, toward where he knew the Dungeon Core waited in its chamber.

"The Core is currently in passive mode," he said. "It processes mana, maintains the dungeon structure, handles basic functions. But it doesn't *think*. Doesn't optimize. Doesn't strategize. It's been running on legacy systems for eight centuries."

He turned to face his assembled staff.

"Tomorrow, I wake it up. And then we have a conversation about... synergy."

> **[ARMI - ALERT]**
> Dungeon Core-7749: Communication Protocol Available
> Warning: Core Intelligence unpredictable after extended dormancy
> Estimated Dormancy Period: 847 years
> Recommendation: Proceed with caution. Prepare contingency protocols.

Victor dismissed the warning with a thought.

He'd never been cautious when opportunity presented itself.

And the opportunity before him now was worth any risk.
