# Chapter 50: The Audit

Dawn painted the forest gold.

Victor stood at the dungeon entrance, a silver tea tray balanced on one hand. Steam curled from a ceramic pot—the good one, imported from Oakhaven's upper market. Three cups. Three saucers. Three sets of cutlery.

He looked toward the treeline. Approximately forty meters out, behind a cluster of birch trees, three figures in muted brown cloaks thought they were invisible.

They were not.

Victor raised his free hand and waved.

"Good morning!" His voice carried easily across the clearing. "I couldn't help but notice you've been watching since yesterday. That must be exhausting. Would you like some tea?"

The forest went silent. The figures froze.

Victor continued waving, his smile fixed and pleasant.

After a long moment, one of the cloaked figures stood. Then the other two. They exchanged glances—the particular glance of professionals who had been caught doing something they thought was clever.

The lead figure pushed back his hood. Male. Middle-aged. A face that had seen too many dungeon inspections and not enough sunlight. A bronze badge glinted on his chest: the Adventurer Guild's crossed swords over an open ledger.

"You knew we were here," the man said. It wasn't a question.

"Since dawn yesterday." Victor set the tea tray on a flat rock near the entrance. "My head of reconnaissance is a goblin with excellent night vision and no concept of personal space. He's been counting your footsteps."

> **[ARMI]**  
> Target Identified: Guild Inspector Aldric Vorne. Level 12. Specialization: Regulatory Enforcement.  
> Threat Classification: Bureaucratic.  
> **Recommended Approach**: Weaponized Transparency.

The inspector approached cautiously, his two colleagues flanking him. They were younger—junior investigators with notebooks and quills, ready to document everything.

"Inspector Aldric Vorne," the man said, producing a sealed scroll. "Adventurer Guild, Regulatory Affairs. I have authorization to investigate reports of an unlicensed dungeon operation in this jurisdiction."

Victor took the scroll. Broke the seal. Read it carefully.

"Unlicensed?" He raised an eyebrow. "I have permits from Lord Sterling himself. Would you like to see them?"

"Sterling's permits are provisional," Vorne said flatly. "They don't supersede Guild jurisdiction. We have reports of monster collusion, unlawful detention of adventurers, and tax irregularities."

"Fascinating." Victor handed the scroll back. "And your source for these reports?"

Vorne's face remained carefully neutral. "Anonymous."

"Guildmaster Groll, then." Victor smiled. "He does like his anonymous complaints. Please—come inside. If you're going to investigate, you might as well do it properly."

He gestured toward the dungeon entrance.

"Full access. Complete transparency. I insist."

**

The first floor of Insolvia Holdings looked nothing like a monster den.

The torches burned at regulation height. The stone corridors were swept clean. Every thirty feet, a small sign indicated the floor number, emergency exits, and a customer service message: *Insolvia Holdings thanks you for your patronage!*

Inspector Vorne walked slowly, his colleagues scribbling furiously in their notebooks. His brow furrowed deeper with every step.

"This is..." He searched for words. "Unexpectedly organized."

"We prefer 'aggressively compliant,'" Victor said. He walked beside the inspector with the ease of a man giving a tour of his summer home. "Sniv? The records, please."

The goblin appeared from a side corridor. He wore his tie, his clipboard, and an expression of profound professional seriousness. Under his arm, he carried a stack of parchment thick enough to stop a crossbow bolt.

"Official audit documentation!" Sniv announced, thrusting the stack into the arms of the nearest junior inspector. The young man staggered under the weight. "Entry logs! Safety protocols! Revenue statements! Incident reports! Sniv organize *alphabetically* AND *chronologically*! Very thorough!"

Vorne took a page from the top of the stack. His eyes scanned the neat columns of figures—entry fees, loot processing charges, health potion sales, insurance premiums.

"You charge adventurers... insurance?"

"Against dismemberment or death occurring on premises," Victor explained. "Standard liability coverage. The payout goes to next of kin, minus a reasonable administrative fee."

"And if they don't buy insurance?"

"They sign a waiver. Page twelve, clause seven: 'The undersigned acknowledges all risk and absolves Insolvia Holdings of responsibility for injuries sustained during voluntary recreational activities.'"

Vorne flipped to page twelve. The waiver was there. Extensive. Legally airtight.

"Every dead adventurer signed waiver!" Sniv added helpfully. "Legal! Very legal!"

One of the junior inspectors leaned toward his colleague. "Did he just say 'dead adventurer'?"

"Processed adventurer," Victor corrected smoothly. "We've had... incidents. All documented per Guild reporting requirements. Would you like to see the incident logs?"

"There are incident logs?"

"Forty-seven pages." Victor smiled. "We're very thorough."

> **[ARMI]**  
> Audit Status: Hostile → Confused.  
> Target Cognition: Overwhelmed by documentation volume.  
> **Recommendation**: Continue overwhelming.

They reached the second floor. Asterion was waiting.

The minotaur stood at the corridor junction in his SECURITY sash, greataxe polished to a mirror shine. He did not move. He did not blink. He simply *loomed*.

Vorne's hand went to his sword. The junior inspectors took a step back.

"Inspector, meet our Chief Security Officer." Victor gestured casually. "Asterion handles non-lethal containment and customer relations."

"Customer... relations?" Vorne's voice was strangled.

"When adventurers become... enthusiastic, Asterion redirects their energy. We have an excellent track record. Zero fatalities in the past thirty days."

Asterion rumbled. It might have been a greeting. It might have been a threat assessment. With minotaurs, it was hard to tell.

"The creature is employed?" Vorne asked.

"The *colleague* is contracted." Victor produced a document from his jacket. "Standard employment agreement. Health benefits, quarterly reviews, competitive compensation. Would you like to see his performance evaluations?"

"He has... performance evaluations?"

"Exceeds expectations in threat deterrence. Meets expectations in verbal communication. Room for improvement in customer hospitality." Victor tucked the document away. "We're working on it."

Asterion executed something that might have been a bow. Or a head-butt warning. The effect was identical.

The Core Chamber was the final stop.

Nova hung in the center of the room—a pulsing crystal orb, beautiful and ancient. The scouts stared at it with the particular hunger of men who had finally found what they were looking for.

"The dungeon core," Vorne breathed.

"Automated magical infrastructure," Victor corrected. "Responsible for environmental controls, monster generation, and facility maintenance. Think of it as... a very sophisticated heating system."

"It's sentient."

"Define sentient." Victor clasped his hands behind his back. "It responds to stimuli. It optimizes operations. It follows programmed directives. Many complex systems do the same. Your claim forms, for example."

Vorne's jaw tightened. He walked a slow circle around Nova, examining the crystal from every angle. The Core remained silent—Victor had briefed Nova on the importance of appearing *mechanical* rather than *sapient*.

"I find no evidence of collusion," Vorne said finally. His voice was clipped. Frustrated. "No evidence of unlawful detention. No evidence of unreported revenue."

"I told you," Victor said. "Complete transparency."

Vorne turned to face him. The inspector's eyes were sharp, calculating. The eyes of a man who knew he was missing something but couldn't prove what.

"Your permits," Vorne said slowly, "are granted by Lord Sterling. Provisional authorization for dungeon operation in his territory."

"Correct."

"Lord Sterling's territorial authority covers Eastmarch. But the Adventurer Guild has Crown jurisdiction. We operate under royal charter." Vorne smiled. It was not a pleasant smile. "If we petition the Crown, Sterling's authorization becomes... negotiable."

Victor's expression didn't change. But inside, ARMI was already processing.

> **[ARMI - THREAT ANALYSIS]**  
> Vector Identified: Jurisdictional Challenge.  
> Guild Strategy: Bypass Sterling → Appeal to Crown → Invalidate Permits.  
> **Risk Level**: High.  
> **Counter-Strategy Required**: Secure Crown support before Guild petition.

"You've found a loophole," Victor said. "I'm impressed."

"We're very thorough," Vorne echoed, throwing Victor's words back at him. "Expect formal proceedings within the month. Good day, Mr. Kaine."

The scouts departed. Their footsteps echoed up the stairway, fading into silence.

**

The moment they were gone, Valerius burst from behind a pillar where he'd been hiding.

"They're going to invalidate our permits!" His voice cracked. "They'll petition the Crown! Sterling can't protect us from royal oversight!"

Victor watched the empty stairway. His mind was racing, calculating trajectories, assets, leverage points.

"Then we need the Crown on our side before they do."

Nova pulsed. "THE CROWN? THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION."

"The Guild thinks they're playing politics." Victor turned from the stairway. His eyes were cold. Focused. The eyes of a man who had just identified his next acquisition target. "They forget—I *invented* this game."

He looked at Sniv. The goblin stood at attention, clipboard ready.

"Get me everything we have on Crown Prince Aldric. His debts. His vices. His ambitions. I want to know what he wants before he knows he wants it."

Sniv's eyes went wide. "We go... UP?"

"We go all the way up." Victor straightened his suit jacket. "The Guild wants to play Crown jurisdiction? Fine. Let's see who gets to the Crown first."

> **[ARMI]**  
> **Act 1.2: External Threats — COMPLETE.**  
> Strategic Position: Dungeon Secured. Sterling Partnership Pending. Guild Hostile.  
> **Act 1.3: Defense & Growth — INITIATED.**  
> Next Target: Crown Prince Aldric of Valdris.  
> **Victor Kaine's Assessment**: Kings are just customers with bigger budgets.
