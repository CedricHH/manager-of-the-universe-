# Chapter 49: The Response

Gareth stared at the parchment.

The numbers were there. Clean. Precise. Undeniable. Ten thousand gold pieces. Annual. And that was the *conservative* estimate.

His family's estate—the Sterling manor, the toll roads, the licensing fees—generated perhaps two thousand gold in a good year. Half of that went to Crown taxes, obligations, and the never-ending cost of maintaining appearances.

This man in a suit was offering five times that. For a partnership.

"You're hesitating," Victor observed. He hadn't touched his tea. His eyes were fixed on Gareth with the patience of a predator watching prey tire itself out. "That's interesting. Most men would have signed already."

"Most men aren't Sterlings."

"No." Victor's smile was thin. "Most men don't have something to prove to their uncles."

Gareth's hand tightened on the parchment. The words cut precisely because they were true. Lord Reginald had sent him here to evaluate. To report. Not to *negotiate*.

But if he returned with mere observations, he was exactly what his uncle thought: a messenger. An errand boy in expensive armor.

If he returned with *this*...

"What's in it for me?" Gareth asked. The words came out before he could stop them. Raw. Naked self-interest.

Victor's smile widened. Just slightly. The smile of a man who had found the pressure point.

"A finder's fee," Victor said. "Five percent of Sterling's annual share, paid to you personally. Off the books, naturally. Your uncle never needs to know."

> **[ARMI]**  
> Incentive Alignment: Detected.  
> Target Motivation: Personal Profit + Reputation Rehabilitation.  
> Probability of Cooperation: 89%.

Gareth looked at the parchment again. Five percent of Sterling's cut. If the numbers held, that was over a hundred gold a year—just for carrying a piece of paper to his uncle and recommending approval.

More than his personal allowance. More than his tournament winnings.

"You're bribing me," Gareth said.

"I'm aligning our interests." Victor leaned back. "When you present this proposal to Lord Sterling, you'll advocate for it. Not because I bribed you—because you'll *believe* in it. And you'll believe in it because you'll personally benefit from its success. That's not corruption, Sir Gareth. That's good business."

The terms took an hour to finalize.

Victor had a quill. He had parchment. He had an annoying habit of writing faster than Gareth could argue.

"Sterling provides legitimacy," Victor summarized, his pen scratching. "Trade route access. Political cover. The permits we need to operate openly. In return, Insolvia Holdings provides a dungeon revenue stream—entry fees, loot processing, monster parts—plus an exclusive contract for adventurer training services."

"My uncle will want a larger cut."

"Your uncle will want forty percent." Victor didn't look up. "I'm offering thirty-five. That's already generous."

"Thirty-five of what?"

"Of *everything*." Victor gestured at the dungeon walls. "Adventurers pay to enter. They pay for upgrades. They pay for healing. They pay for loot appraisal. They pay for insurance. When they die—and some will—we charge corpse recovery fees. It's a comprehensive revenue ecosystem."

Gareth's knight—the scarred woman who'd had the sense not to attack Asterion—spoke for the first time. "Does any of that... actually exist?"

"Not yet." Victor set down his quill. "That's why I need Sterling. I have the dungeon. I have the monsters. I have the operational model. What I don't have is the infrastructure above ground. Trade routes. Guild connections. Political protection. Your family controls all of that."

He slid the finished document across the table.

"Thirty-five percent of a rapidly growing empire, or one hundred percent of whatever crumbs the Alchemist Cartel leaves you. Those are Lord Sterling's options."

> **[ARMI]**  
> **Contract Drafted**: Sterling Vertical Integration Agreement.  
> Terms: 35/65 Revenue Split, Sterling provides Legitimacy, Victor provides Operations.  
> Status: Pending Lord Sterling Approval.  
> **Finder's Fee Clause**: Hidden. Gareth Commission: 5% of Sterling share.

Gareth read the document. His lips moved as he worked through the legalese—Victor had written it in proper Guild contract form, all clauses and subclauses and liability limitations. It was dense. It was professional.

It was exactly what his uncle would expect from a serious business proposition.

"I'll take this to Lord Sterling," Gareth said finally. "But I make no promises on his behalf."

"I'd expect nothing less." Victor stood. He extended his hand. "Pleasure doing business, Sir Gareth."

Gareth looked at the hand. At the man attached to it. Twenty minutes ago, he'd wanted to kill Victor Kaine. Now he was considering whether to recommend a partnership that would make his uncle one of the wealthiest lords in Eastmarch.

He shook the hand.

Victor's grip was firm. Businesslike. The handshake of equals—or at least, the appearance of it.

"Your escort will see you out," Victor said. "Asterion?"

The minotaur materialized from the shadows. He'd been there the whole time, Gareth realized. Watching. Waiting! The creature's presence was a reminder: Victor negotiated from strength, not need.

"This way," Asterion rumbled.

The moment Gareth's party disappeared up the stairs, Nova's crystal flared.

"ADMINISTRATOR. ANOMALY DETECTED. EXTERNAL PERIMETER."

Victor turned to face the Core. The pleasant merchant mask fell away, replaced by something sharper. Colder. The face he wore when problems required solving.

"Elaborate."

"SURFACE SENSORS REPORT SUSTAINED OBSERVATION. NON-COMBATANT SIGNATURES. THREE POINTS, TRIANGULATED AROUND PRIMARY ENTRANCE."

Before Victor could respond, the door burst open.

Sniv came skidding into the chamber, clipboard clutched to his chest, eyes wild with the particular excitement of a goblin who had discovered important information.

"Boss! Boss!" He waved his arms frantically. "Strangers in forest! Not adventurers! Not Sterling people! Different!"

"Calm down." Victor crossed to the goblin. "What kind of different?"

"They hide!" Sniv's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "They watch. They write in little books! They count things! Sniv counted them counting—three of them, Boss! In trees, behind rocks, very sneaky! But Sniv is sneakier!"

Victor's jaw tightened. He looked at Nova. Nova pulsed confirmation.

> **[ARMI - THREAT ASSESSMENT]**

Footsteps on the stairs. Valerius descended into the chamber, parchment clutched in his ink-stained hands. His face was pale. His movements jerky with barely-contained panic.

"The scouts," he gasped. "I saw them from the entrance. Guild badges. They've been there since dawn—I thought they were just passing, but they're *documenting*. Every adventurer that enters, every one that leaves, every coin that changes hands. They're building a case."

"The Alchemist Cartel," Victor said quietly. "Groll. He couldn't destroy us by force, so he's trying the legal route."

"Can he do that?"

"Anyone can file a complaint with the Adventurer Guild." Victor began to pace. His mind was already three steps ahead, mapping the regulatory landscape like a battlefield. "Unlicensed dungeon operation. Tax evasion. Monster collusion. Take your pick. If the Guild opens a formal investigation, they can freeze our assets, close the dungeon, even arrest me."

Nova pulsed. "A LEGAL HOSTILE TAKEOVER."

"Something like that." Victor stopped pacing. He stared at the stairway leading to the surface, at the forest beyond where unseen eyes watched and recorded. "They're not here to fight us. They're here to document us. To build a case so airtight that Sterling's permits won't matter. That my contracts won't matter. That nothing matters except the Guild's authority to shut us down."

Sniv's ears drooped. "Guild is... bad?"

"Guild is the law." Victor's voice was flat. "And the law can be bought. It can be bent. It can be weaponized. Groll knows that. He's fighting me on my own terms now."

This was familiar territory. Victor had watched corporations destroy each other with regulatory complaints. He'd filed a few himself, back on Earth. The beauty of bureaucracy was that it moved slowly—but once it started, it was nearly impossible to stop.

Groll was smart. Smarter than Victor had given him credit for.

He turned to Valerius.

"Get me everything we have on the Adventurer Guild's regulatory framework. Permit codes. Inspection protocols. Every loophole, every clause, every exemption that Sterling's paperwork might provide."

Valerius nodded jerkily, already scribbling notes.

"Sniv." Victor's voice sharpened. "I want surveillance on the surveillance. Track those scouts. Where do they go when they leave? Who do they report to? How often do they rotate?"

"Sniv will be *sneakiest*!" The goblin saluted with his clipboard.

Victor looked at Nova. The Core pulsed—steady, patient, waiting for instructions.

"And Nova... begin calibrating our records. Every transaction documented. Every fee justified. Every monster encounter logged. If they want to audit Insolvia Holdings, we're going to give them the most thorough, most compliant, most *boring* documentation they've ever seen."

He smiled. It wasn't a happy smile. It was the smile of a man who had spent his career navigating bureaucratic warfare, weaponizing compliance, and burying enemies in paperwork.

"Groll thinks he can beat me with regulations." Victor straightened his suit jacket. "He has no idea who he's dealing with."

> **New Protocol Initiated**: Regulatory Warfare.
