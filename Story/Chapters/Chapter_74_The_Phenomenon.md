# Chapter 74: The Phenomenon

Week 2 of the Ember Trials.

The tournament had exploded.

Twenty-three parties registered—nearly double Week 1.

Eighty-seven spectators projected—capacity was fifty.

Victor stood at his office window, watching the chaos below.

The dungeon entrance resembled a festival.

Vendors sold "Ignatia Survivor" t-shirts.

Food stalls offered "Dragon's Breath Ale" and "Ember Roasted Meat."

Children played mock battles, shouting move names they'd seen on projection screens.

Oakhaven's weekly broadsheet ran a front-page story:

**"EMBER TRIALS: THE NEW GOLD RUSH"**

But Victor knew the truth.

With visibility came vultures.

And in Oakhaven, vultures meant **hostile takeovers**.

***

**The Phenomenon**

Zip burst into Victor's office, clipboard trembling.

"Boss! Registration full! Twenty-three parties! Spectator overflow! Need expansion!"

Victor pulled up an ARMI projection.

\u003e **[ARMI]**
\u003e Ember Trials - Week 2 Status
\u003e Parties Registered: 23 (+8 from Week 1, +53% growth)
\u003e Spectators (Projected): 87 (Capacity: 50 - OVERFLOW)
\u003e Broadcast Licenses: 4 taverns × 50 GP = 200 GP
\u003e Total Projected Revenue: 6,800 GP
\u003e Community Fund (10%): 680 GP
\u003e Net Profit: 5,620 GP/week

Victor studied the numbers.

Week 1: 3,100 GP profit (two days).

Week 2: 5,620 GP projected (full week).

The tournament was scaling faster than anticipated.

Valerius entered. "Boss, cultural impact report."

He handed Victor a compiled list:

- **Taverns**: Four establishments now broadcasting tournament matches via licensed projection magic
- **Children**: Playing "Dragon Hunt" in streets, reenacting Crimson Blades' victory
- **Bards**: Composing songs about Ignatia's Phase 3 ultimate ("The Tyrant's Last Roar")
- **Gambling**: Illegal betting pools on match times (Victor made mental note: potential revenue stream)

Victor set the report down.

"We've created a brand."

Valerius nodded. "And brands attract competitors."

"Exactly."

***

**The First Threat**

Afternoon.

A knock at Victor's door.

Asterion's voice: "Boss. Groll is here."

Victor's expression didn't change.

Groll.

Alchemist Guildmaster.

The same man Victor had crushed in Chapter 42's market war.

"Send him in."

Groll entered—older, thinner, but his eyes still sharp with calculation.

"Manager Kaine."

"Guildmaster Groll. I'm surprised you're still in business."

Groll's jaw tightened.

"Funny. I've recovered. Restructured. I'm here with a **business proposal**."

Victor gestured to a chair.

Groll sat.

"The Ember Trials attract adventurers. Adventurers need potions. I propose: exclusive supply contract. I provide all potions to participants. Revenue split: sixty percent me, forty percent you."

Victor waited.

Groll continued.

"It would be... **unfortunate** if participants became ill before their matches. Contaminated water. Bad food. These things happen."

Victor leaned back.

"So. Extortion."

Groll smiled thinly. "I prefer 'incentivized partnership.'"

Victor pulled up supply chain data.

"Counter-proposal: You supply potions at market rate plus ten percent markup. No exclusivity. No revenue split. I retain supplier diversification."

Groll's smile vanished.

"That's insulting."

"That's business," Victor said calmly. "You're welcome to decline."

Groll stood, furious.

"You'll regret this."

"Possibly. But I've regretted worse decisions."

Groll left, slamming the door.

\u003e **[ARMI - THREAT DETECTED]**
\u003e Alchemist Guild: Extortion attempt (potion supply monopoly)
\u003e Threat Level: MODERATE
\u003e Countermeasure: Div ersified supply chain (Merchant's Guild, independent alchemists)
\u003e Vulnerability: Sabotage risk (food/water contamination)
\u003e Recommendation: Monitor participant health metrics

Victor made a note: Install water purification ward. Cost: 200 GP.

***

**The Second Threat**

Evening.

Floor 5 exhibition match.

A company called "Ironclad Mercenaries" entered the arena.

Five warriors—all Level 20+, overqualified for the current tournament difficulty (designed for Level 15-18).

Victor watched from the observation room.

Valerius frowned. "They're Mercenary Guild. Why are they here? They're way above the curve."

Victor understood immediately.

"Demonstration."

The fight began.

Ironclad Company moved with brutal efficiency.

No strategy. No finesse.

Just overwhelming force.

Their tank absorbed Ignatia's Flame Torrent without flinching.

Their DPS burned through Phase 1 in six minutes.

Phase 2 lasted four minutes.

Phase 3—Ignatia's ultimate **Inferno Burst**—they tanked it with a Tier-3 defensive barrier.

Total time: **14 minutes, 3 seconds.**

New record.

But the crowd reacted... negatively.

"That's not fair!"

"They're showing off!"

"Where's the challenge?"

Victor's lips curled slightly.

The Mercenary Guild had miscalculated.

***

Post-match.

Mercenary Guildmaster Kael approached Victor's office.

Tall, scarred, professional soldier.

"Manager Kaine. Impressive operation."

Victor waited.

"I have a proposal. Partner with us. We provide 'elite difficulty' tier for premium customers. Higher entry fees. Seventy-thirty split, our favor."

Victor understood the real goal: **Control difficulty = control outcomes = gambling opportunities.**

"Interesting," Victor said. "But I already control difficulty."

He pulled up Ignatia's configuration file.

"The dragon has ten difficulty tiers. Current setting: Tier 3 (Level 15-18). I haven't activated Tiers 4-10 yet."

Kael blinked.

Victor continued.

"Tier 10 scales Ignatia to Level 35. She gains two additional phases. Environmental hazards triple. If you want elite difficulty, I'll add it. But I don't need partners to do that."

Kael's expression hardened.

"Shame if Mercenary Guild members stopped participating. Tournaments need competitors."

Victor met his gaze.

"I have twenty-three parties registered this week. Lose five, I still have eighteen. You need exposure—your members want fame, prize money, and glory. I provide the platform. Rethink your leverage, Guildmaster."

Kael left without another word.

\u003e **[ARMI - THREAT DETECTED]**
\u003e Mercenary Guild: Partnership extortion (elite difficulty monopoly)
\u003e Threat Level: MODERATE
\u003e Countermeasure: Difficulty scaling already implemented (Tiers 1-10)
\u003e Vulnerability: Coordinated boycott risk
\u003e Recommendation: Maintain participant diversity

Two guilds.

Two threats.

One pattern emerging.

***

**The Third Guild**

Late evening.

Voros Thane (Merchant's Guildmaster, Victor's loan partner) arrived.

Unlike Groll and Kael, Voros looked... excited.

"Victor. We need to talk about **scaling**."

Victor gestured him in.

Voros sat, pulling out a map.

"The Ember Trials are working. But you're thinking too small."

He pointed to five cities on the map.

"Oakhaven. Rivercrest. Stonewatch. Merchant's Crossing. Goldspire."

"Each city has dungeons. Each has adventurers. Each needs entertainment."

Voros leaned forward.

"Franchise model. You provide tournament structure—rules, branding, difficulty tiers. I handle logistics—transport, security, supply chains. Revenue split: fifty-fifty."

Victor studied the map.

"You're proposing I expand to five cities."

"Initially. Ten within a year."

Victor pulled up projections.

\u003e **[ARMI - OPPORTUNITY DETECTED]**
\u003e Franchise Model: Ember Trials (Multi-City Expansion)
\u003e Projected Revenue: +15,000 GP/month (5 cities × 3,000 GP avg)
\u003e Investment Required: 8,000 GP (setup costs)
\u003e Risk Factors: Quality control, brand dilution, logistics complexity
\u003e ROI Timeline: 6 months breakeven, 18 months profitable
\u003e Recommendation: Pilot program (1 city, 3-month trial)

Victor considered.

Unlike Groll and Kael, Voros wasn't threatening.

He was offering genuine partnership.

"I'll consider it," Victor said. "But Oakhaven stays mine. One hundred percent control."

Voros nodded. "Agreed. Expansion cities only. You're the franchisor. I'm the operator."

"Pilot program," Victor countered. "One city. Three months. If it works, we discuss expansion."

Voros extended his hand.

"Deal."

They shook.

After Voros left, Victor sat alone.

Three guilds.

Three approaches.

Groll: Extortion.
Kael: Control.
Voros: Partnership.

Only one was thinking long-term.

Victor approved the pilot program.

Investment: 8,000 GP.

Target city: Rivercrest (population 40,000, active dungeon, no established entertainment).

Launch: Four weeks.

**Morning - The Crisis**

Next day.

6:00 AM.

Zip burst into Victor's office, panicked.

"Boss! PROBLEM!"

Victor looked up from financial projections.

"Define problem."

"All twenty-three parties! Withdrawn! Tournament canceled!"

Victor went still.

"Explain."

Zip handed him a stack of letters—identical format, anonymous sender.

\u003e **WARNING**
\u003e
\u003e Participation in Ember Trials may result in... complications.
\u003e
\u003e Consider your supply chains carefully.
\u003e
\u003e - Concerned Citizens

Twenty-three parties.

Twenty-three identical letters.

Coordinated.

Victor pulled up today's spectator reservations: **92 attendees**.

They'd paid in advance.

They expected a tournament.

They'd get an empty arena.

\u003e **[ARMI - CRISIS ALERT]**
\u003e Tournament Boycott: Coordinated guild cartel action
\u003e Parties Withdrawn: 23/23 (100%)
\u003e Spectator Expectations: 92 attendees, ZERO content
\u003e Reputation Damage: CRITICAL
\u003e Revenue Loss: 3,400 GP (this week)
\u003e Public Opinion Impact: -60% (projected)
\u003e Recommendation: EMERGENCY COUNTERMEASURES REQUIRED

Victor stared at the empty registration board.

The guilds had coordinated.

Groll + Kael + others = unified pressure.

They weren't competing for control.

They were forming a **cartel**.

Standard corporate tactic: If you can't buy the asset, destroy its value, then acquire it cheap.

Victor stood.

Walked to the window.

Looked down at the gathering crowd—spectators arriving early, excited, unaware.

His mind calculated options:

- **Option 1**: Refund spectators. (Revenue loss: 4,600 GP. Reputation damage: moderate.)
- **Option 2**: Cancel and blame guilds. (Political, risky.)
- **Option 3**: Run tournament without external parties. (How?)

Victor's eyes narrowed.

Then he spoke one word.

"Escalate."

Valerius looked up. "Boss?"

Victor turned.

"Call Asterion, Sniv, Gorg, Ignatia, Zip, and Valerius. Emergency meeting. Five minutes."

"What's the plan?"

Victor's expression was cold.

"If the guilds won't let adventurers fight Ignatia..."

He pulled up the employee roster.

"...then my **employees** will."

 ***

**STATUS**: Week 2 Ember Trials viral success (23 parties, 87 spectators, cultural phenomenon status). Guild threats: Alchemist (extortion via potion monopoly), Mercenary (elite difficulty leverage), Merchant (legitimate franchise offer accepted - pilot program approved). Coordinated guild boycott executed—all 23 parties withdrawn via threatening letters. Crisis: 92 paid spectators, zero content. Victor's countermeasure: Employee exhibition matches. Emergency meeting called.
