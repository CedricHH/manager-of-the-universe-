# Chapter 30: The Partnership

The Iron Wolves stood before the boss chamber door.

Ancient stone, carved with warnings in a language that predated the current kingdom. Scorch marks from previous encounters. The faint smell of blood that never quite faded from combat arenas.

"Optional premium encounter," Sniv recited from his clipboard. "Boss-class opponent. Chief Security Officer Asterion. Survival earns Epic-tier rewards. Insurance purchased. Non-lethal protocol active."

Gareth gripped his sword. "Let's get this over with."

The doors opened.

Asterion stood in the center of the arena, massive axe resting across his shoulders. Eight feet of muscle, horn, and ancient patience. His eyes—intelligent, measuring—swept across the party.

"I am Asterion," the Minotaur rumbled. "Chief Security Officer of Insolvia Holdings. You have ten minutes to demonstrate competence. This is not a death match. This is a *performance evaluation*. Begin."

Gareth charged.

---

The fight lasted exactly eight minutes.

Asterion tested each party member with clinical precision, adjusting his power output to match their skill level. He wasn't trying to kill them—he was *assessing* them.

Gareth's aggression earned a C-minus. Reckless. Predictable. Would benefit from strategic consultation.

Mira's tactics earned a B-plus. Adaptable. Creative use of environmental factors. Management potential.

Bron's defense earned a solid A. Professional. Reliable. No wasted movement.

Tessa's evasion earned an A-plus. Natural talent. High ceiling. Recommend accelerated development track.

At the eight-minute mark, Asterion stopped.

"Sufficient," he announced. "You may proceed to the treasure room."

Gareth was breathing hard, sword hanging at his side. "We... won?"

"You *survived*," Asterion corrected. "That is different. But per company policy, survival earns rewards. Follow the goblin to the loot distribution center."

---

The treasure room was not what they expected.

No scattered piles of gold. No random equipment dumped in corners. Instead: organized displays. Labeled categories. A quality-controlled inventory system that would make any merchant guild weep with envy.

"Standard loot included with entry fee," Sniv explained, gesturing to the first section. "Healing potions, common-grade weapons, miscellaneous supplies. Take what you need."

"And that?" Mira pointed to the roped-off section labeled "PREMIUM."

"Available for additional purchase. Higher quality. Verified enchantments. Satisfaction guaranteed or refund on your next visit."

Victor's voice crackled from hidden speakers. "I don't stock garbage. Repeat customers expect consistency. Everything in that section has been quality-tested and priced according to verified market rates."

Mira examined a staff in the premium section. Blue wood, runes of power carved along its length, a crystal focus that hummed with contained energy. "This is... actually high quality."

"I told you. Sustainable business model." Victor paused. "Current promotional offer: ten percent discount for returning customers. Fifteen percent if you bring referrals."

Gareth shook his head in disbelief. "You're running a dungeon like a shop."

"I'm running a dungeon like a *business*. There's a difference."

The Iron Wolves spent fifteen gold on premium items. The staff went to Mira. A set of enhanced throwing knives to Tessa. A shield polish kit for Bron (he seemed oddly pleased). Gareth bought nothing, on principle.

*The choice came on a Tuesday.*

*Victor sat in his apartment with everything spread before him. Evidence. Names. Dates. Board meeting recordings his private investigator had obtained through methods Victor didn't ask about.*

*Enough to destroy them. The executives who had blamed him. The directors who had covered up. The shareholders who had looked away.*

*He could sell this information. Blackmail them. Walk away with enough money to rebuild his career, his reputation, his life.*

*Or...*

*Victor compiled everything onto a single USB drive.*

*Then he made copies. Sent them to three different journalists at three different outlets. The families' lawyers. A regulatory contact in Geneva who owed him a favor and hated corporate corruption more than he valued self-preservation.*

*Anonymous. Untraceable. No profit for Victor Kaine.*

*As he finished, his phone buzzed. Unknown number.*

*"You could have sold this. Why didn't you?"*

*Victor stared at the message. He didn't know the answer. Not really. The man who had built a career on cold calculation couldn't explain why he'd just thrown away millions in potential leverage.*

*He typed back: "Ask me when I figure it out."*

*The reply came immediately: "I will. -S"*

*Sarah. She'd been watching. She'd sent the original email that started everything.*

*Victor deleted the conversation. Copied the backup files to a secure server. And waited for the inevitable.*

The Iron Wolves departed through the main entrance.

Mira paused at the threshold. Turned back toward the dungeon interior.

"Same time next week?"

Victor's voice echoed from the darkness. "Ten percent discount. Bring friends."

Gareth muttered something uncomplimentary. Bron nodded once—professional acknowledgment. Tessa waved.

They disappeared into the forest.

Victor pulled up the accounting ledger.

The Core's chamber filled with light.

> **[CORE-7749]**
> ADMINISTRATOR KAINE.
> YOUR PROOF... EXCEEDS PARAMETERS.
> SIGNIFICANTLY.

Victor stood before the crystal, hands clasped behind his back. "I believe we discussed equity partnership for results above one hundred percent."

A long pause. Ancient calculations running through even more ancient systems.

> **[CORE-7749]**
> PARTNERSHIP TERMS... ACCEPTED.
> FULL INFRASTRUCTURE ACCESS GRANTED.
> YOU ARE NOW MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER OF THIS FACILITY.

> **[ARMI - DUNGEON STATUS UPDATE]**

Victor looked at the glowing crystal.

"Welcome to the team, 7749."

The Core's voice shifted. Something that might have been warmth entered its ancient frequencies.

> **[CORE-7749]**
> DESIGNATION... ACCEPTABLE.
> BUT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE...
> CALL ME NOVA.

Victor smiled. His first genuine smile in a very long time.

"Nova it is. Now—let's talk about Phase 3."

The crystal pulsed brighter.

The partnership was official.

And somewhere in the cosmic ledgers of the Galactic Audit Consortium, an entry was updated:

*Asset 8940 (Kaine, Victor): Performance exceeds projections by 233%. Recommend: Priority monitoring. Do not interfere.*

*Yet.*
