# Chapter 93: The Shell Company

The math was simple.

Victor stared at the holographic spreadsheet floating in the caravan's dim interior.

**Coalition Demand:** 70 miracles

**Current Inventory:** 1 miracle ([Blessing: Fertile Soil])

**Galactic Exchange Purchase Limit:** 25,000 GP per week (Tier 0)

**Average Miracle Cost:** 40,000 GP

**Weekly Capacity:** 0.625 miracles

**Fulfillment Timeline:** 112 weeks

He had thirty days.

The numbers didn't work.

> **[ARMI - Supply Chain Analysis]**
> **Bottleneck Identified:** Reputation Tier System
> **Current Tier:** 0 (Unverified - 3/10 transactions)
> **Tier 1 Unlock Requirement:** 10 transactions
> **Tier 1 Benefits:** 100k GP/week limit + Shell Company Access

Victor tapped the table.

Shell companies.

Each shell would function as an independent Tier 0 account. Separate reputation. Separate purchase limits. Separate mana signatures.

Ten shells × 25,000 GP per week = 250,000 GP buying power.

Add his main account at Tier 1 (100,000 GP/week) = **350,000 GP total weekly capacity**.

350,000 ÷ 40,000 per miracle = 8.75 miracles per week.

Seventy miracles ÷ 8.75 = eight weeks.

*That* fit within the thirty-day Consortium deadline.

"Kade," Victor called.

The mercenary captain poked his head through the curtain. "Yeah, Boss?"

"How long until we reach Oakhaven?"

"Sixteen hours if we push. Twenty if we rest the horses."

"Push," Victor said. "I'll pay the horse replacement costs."

Kade grinned. "You got it."

Victor turned back to the Exchange interface.

First problem: He needed seven more transactions to unlock Tier 1.

Second problem: He needed those transactions *fast*.

Third problem: Each transaction had to look legitimate—not like he was gaming the reputation system.

He opened the Exchange marketplace. Applied filters.

**Search Criteria:**
- Price: Under 1,000 GP
- Resale Margin: 50%+
- Delivery Time: Instant Transfer available
- Worlds: Any

Results populated.

> **[Healing Potion - Basic]:** 45 GP (World 12-A) → 89 GP (Terra-Insolvia marketplace)
> **[Mana Crystal - Fragment]:** 120 GP (World 8-F) → 310 GP resale
> **[Steel Ingot - Refined]:** 15 GP (World 22-D) → 48 GP resale
> **[Enchanted Rope - 50ft]:** 78 GP (World 5-C) → 201 GP resale

Victor selected the healing potions first. Purchased ten.

> **[Transaction #4 Complete]**
> **Item:** [Healing Potion - Basic] × 10
> **Cost:** 450 GP
> **Reputation:** 4/10

He immediately listed them on Terra-Insolvia's secondary market at 89 GP each.

Sold in four minutes.

> **[Sale Complete]**
> **Revenue:** 890 GP
> **Profit:** 440 GP (97.7% ROI)

Next: Mana Crystals.

> **[Transaction #5 Complete]**
> **Cost:** 1,200 GP (10 fragments)
> **Resale:** 3,100 GP
> **Profit:** 1,900 GP

**Reputation:** 5/10

Steel ingots. Enchanted rope. Alchemical reagents.

Victor worked methodically. Each purchase took ninety seconds. Each resale took three to five minutes.

Barnaby's voice drifted from outside: "Boss, you okay in there? You've been muttering about 'margins' for twenty minutes."

"Fine," Victor called back. "Just optimizing."

"That's what worries me."

***

Six hours later, the caravan crossed into Oakhaven's outer district.

> **[ARMI - Transaction Log]**
> **Reputation:** 9/10
> **Total Spent:** 8,200 GP
> **Total Revenue:** 21,300 GP
> **Net Profit:** 13,100 GP

One more transaction to unlock Tier 1.

Victor scrolled through high-value items. He needed something strategic—not just profitable, but *useful*.

Then he found it.

> **[Dungeon Core Fragment]**
> **World:** 31-B (Collapsed Dungeon Zone)
> **Price:** 18,000 GP
> **Description:** Inert core shard from destroyed dungeon. Contains residual mana. Crafting material for dungeon expansion or mana batteries.

Victor checked Terra-Insolvia's market.

Dungeon Core Fragments sold for 45,000 GP minimum—only dungeon administrators bought them, and supply was extremely limited.

But more importantly: **Nova** could use it.

His dungeon partner needed expansion materials. This would strengthen their operation while completing the tenth transaction.

Victor purchased it.

> **[Transaction #10 Complete]**
> **Cost:** 18,000 GP
> **Item:** [Dungeon Core Fragment]
> **Revenue (Projected):** 45,000 GP (or dungeon integration)

Then the interface changed.

Golden light flared across the hologram.

> **[TIER 1 UNLOCKED]**
> **Congratulations, User_7749**
> **New Reputation Tier:** Verified Merchant (Tier 1)
> **Weekly Purchase Limit:** 100,000 GP
> **New Features Unlocked:**
> - Shell Company Registration
> - Bulk Vendor Access
> - Enhanced Anonymity Protocols
> - Priority Dispute Resolution

Victor exhaled.

There it was.

Shell Company Registration.

He opened the interface.

> **[Shell Company Registration]**
> **Cost:** 5,000 GP per shell
> **Function:** Each shell operates as independent Tier 0 account with separate mana signature, purchase history, and reputation tracking.
> **Benefits:**
> - Distribute purchases across multiple identities
> - Avoid triggering volume-based surveillance
> - Separate risk pools (if one shell is compromised, others remain operational)
> **Limit:** 50 shells maximum (Tier 2 unlocks unlimited shells)

Victor did the math.

Ten shells × 5,000 GP = 50,000 GP investment.

But those ten shells would give him 250,000 GP additional weekly buying power.

ROI on infrastructure: Immediate.

He registered ten shells.

Company names randomized by the Exchange:
- Greystone Mercantile Ltd.
- Silverpeak Imports Co.
- Ironhaven Trading Partners
- Duskwater Ventures
- (Six more...)

Each appeared as a separate entity on the Exchange. Each with its own transaction history (zero), its own purchase limits (25,000 GP/week), its own mana signature.

Perfect compartmentalization.

> **[ARMI - Capital Update]**
> **Starting Balance:** 130,930 GP
> **Micro-Trade Profit:** +13,100 GP
> **Shell Registration Cost:** -50,000 GP
> **Core Fragment Purchase:** -18,000 GP
> **Current Balance:** 76,030 GP

Victor winced. Capital was lower than he'd like. But the infrastructure was in place.

Now he could scale.

***

The caravan rolled through Oakhaven's gates at midnight.

Victor stepped out into familiar streets. The dungeon entrance glowed faintly in the distance—Nova's mana signature, steady and strong.

"Boss!" Sniv's voice squeaked from the shadows. The goblin sprinted forward, nearly tripping over his own feet. "Boss is back! Sniv missed Boss! Dungeon has been... uh... busy."

"Busy how?"

Sniv's ears flattened. "Three kinds of busy. Good busy: Revenue up 18% from Ember Trials. Bad busy: Church people watching entrance. Scary busy: Very official Court Summons with wax seal arrived."

Victor sighed. "Show me."

They walked to the dungeon. Asterion stood at the entrance, arms crossed, his minotaur bulk blocking the doorway.

"Victor," the minotaur rumbled. "Welcome back. We have... complications."

"I heard. Church surveillance. Court summons. Anything else?"

Asterion handed him a sealed envelope. "Merchant Guild representative arrived six hours ago. Says it's urgent. Also, Nova wants to talk to you immediately—something about 'mana fluctuations in the Exchange network.'"

Victor broke the wax seal on the Court Summons.

> **HIGH PRIESTESS AURELIA**
> **Church of Eternal Light - Sunspire Cathedral**
>
> Victor Kaine,
>
> You are hereby summoned to formal inquiry regarding allegations of unauthorized divine commerce. Failure to appear within five (5) days constitutes admission of heresy.
>
> Location: Sunspire Cathedral, Third Sanctum
> Time: Sunrise, Fifth Day Hence
>
> Non-negotiable.

Victor folded the summons. "Asterion. Who's the Merchant Guild representative?"

"Voros Thane. The one who negotiated our loan."

Interesting.

"And Nova's concern?"

"She detected surveillance spells woven into the Exchange network. Said they're 'not Church magic'—something older. She wants you in the Core Chamber immediately."

Victor glanced at the sky. Midnight. He'd been awake for eighteen hours.

But the Consortium deadline wasn't going to wait for sleep.

"Get Voros. Bring him to the Core Chamber. I'll talk to Nova first, then him."

"Understood."

Victor walked into the dungeon.

***

The Core Chamber pulsed with blue-white light.

Nova's crystalline form hovered above her pedestal, fractals of mana swirling in agitation.

"Victor." Her voice echoed. "You've been using the Galactic Exchange."

"Yes."

"And you didn't think to mention you'd connected our dungeon's mana grid to an **extradimensional marketplace**?"

Victor paused. "Is that a problem?"

"It's a *massive* problem!" Nova's light flared. "Every transaction you make leaves a mana trace. Those traces connect back to this dungeon. I've been filtering them to prevent Church detection, but three hours ago, I detected **counter-surveillance**."

"Someone's watching the watchers," Victor said.

"Exactly. And it's not Church magic. It's Consortium-level encryption. Someone from the Galactic Audit Consortium is **monitoring your Exchange activity**."

Victor's pulse quickened. "Hestia?"

"No. Different signature. Whoever it is, they have administrator access."

> **[ARMI - Threat Analysis]**
> **Surveillance Detected:** G.A.C. Audit Division (suspected)
> **Risk Level:** HIGH
> **Implication:** Shell companies may already be flagged

A notification appeared on Victor's Exchange interface.

> **[PRIORITY MESSAGE - HESTIA_AUDITOR]**
> **Subject:** Tier 1 Achievement Flagged
> **Status:** URGENT

Victor opened it.

> Victor,
>
> Congratulations on Tier 1. But you triggered Compliance Review.
>
> Ten transactions in 48 hours + ten shell company registrations = algorithmic red flag for money laundering.
>
> G.A.C. Audit Division dispatched. ETA: 72 hours.
>
> They will review ALL accounts. If they find irregularities—like, say, miracle arbitrage involving Church monopolies—your ENTIRE operation freezes.
>
> Suggest: Sanitize records, prepare explanations, or pay the expedited clearance fee (25,000 GP).
>
> Your move.
>
> -H

Victor closed the message.

Looked at Nova.

"Did you know this would happen?" the Core asked quietly.

"I knew rapid scaling would draw attention," Victor said. "I didn't know they had automated compliance systems."

"And now?"

Victor pulled up his ledger.

**Current Capital:** 76,030 GP

**G.A.C. Clearance Fee:** 25,000 GP

**Coalition Payment (pending):** 180,000 GP (90,000 GP advance for 2 estates)

If he paid the fee, he'd have 51,030 GP left—not enough to buy the miracles needed for Coalition delivery.

But if he didn't pay, the audit would freeze his accounts. Coalition delivery would fail. Church would re-monopolize.

And his Consortium deadline would collapse.

Victor made the calculation.

Transferred 25,000 GP.

> **[G.A.C. Expedited Clearance: APPROVED]**
> **Audit Status:** CANCELED
> **Accounts:** CLEARED
> **Shell Companies:** VERIFIED

The notification vanished.

> **[ARMI - Capital Update]**
> **Balance:** 51,030 GP
> **Status:** CRITICAL - Below operational threshold

Nova's light dimmed. "Victor. You just spent half our capital on... bureaucracy."

"I spent it on time," Victor corrected. "Time to execute Coalition delivery. Time to reach the million-gold goal. The fee was infrastructure—same as the shells."

"And if the Coalition doesn't pay?"

"Then we're bankrupt in six days."

Footsteps echoed.

Asterion entered with Voros Thane—the Merchant Guild auditor who'd negotiated their loan months ago.

Voros was a tall man with silver-streaked hair and sharp eyes.

He looked at Victor. At Nova. At the glowing Exchange interface still visible.

And smiled.

"Mr. Kaine," Voros said. "I represent clients who are *very* interested in your recent... miracle sales."

Victor met his gaze. "Which clients?"

"The ones the Church is hunting. The Southern Coalition."

Victor didn't react.

Voros continued. "They've authorized me to negotiate on their behalf. Full logistics support. Legal protection. Distribution network. In exchange for twenty percent of gross revenue."

"Why would I accept that?" Victor asked.

"Because the Church just issued a heresy decree," Voros said. "As of six hours ago, 'unauthorized miracle distribution' is punishable by Inquisitorial Trial. That means asset seizure, imprisonment, and execution if convicted."

He pulled out a document. "But Merchant Guild Privilege grants client-attorney confidentiality. If miracles are transported under Guild charter, the Church can't compel disclosure without Imperial Court order. That takes months."

Victor studied the contract.

It was... generous.

Too generous.

"What's your real angle?" Victor asked.

Voros's smile widened. "The Church's miracle monopoly has strangled provincial trade for decades. If you can break that monopoly, nobles will have 30,000 GP per miracle to spend on *other things*. Guild services. Transport. Luxury goods. We don't want your cut, Mr. Kaine. We want the **market disruption**."

Victor looked at Nova.

The Core's light pulsed once. *Your call.*

Victor turned back to Voros.

"Twenty percent," Victor said. "But I want full transport security, buyer anonymity, and legal fronts for all deliveries."

"Done."

They shook hands.

> **[ARMI - Partnership Confirmed]**
> **Merchant's Guild (Voros Thane):** Logistics + Legal Protection
> **Victor's Share:** 80% of miracle revenue
> **Guild Share:** 20%
> **Coalition Delivery Risk:** Reduced 72%

Victor pulled up the Southern Coalition contract.

First delivery: Two estates. Ten miracles. 180,000 GP.

With Voros's logistics support, he could execute via secure Guild caravans. Church couldn't intercept without violating Guild Privilege.

"When do you need the first delivery?" Voros asked.

"Forty-eight hours."

Voros raised an eyebrow. "Ambitious. Can you source ten miracles that fast?"

Victor opened his shell company interfaces. Ten separate accounts. 25,000 GP purchase limit each.

Total buying power this week: 350,000 GP.

Cost for ten miracles (average 40k GP each): 400,000 GP.

He was 50,000 GP short.

Unless...

"Voros. The Coalition's payment. Can you negotiate fifty-percent advance?"

"Already have," Voros said. "Ninety thousand GP. Transferred upon contract signing."

Victor's balance updated.

> **[Payment Received]**
> **Source:** Southern Coalition (Lady Cassia - Advance Payment)
> **Amount:** 90,000 GP
> **New Balance:** 141,030 GP

Victor opened the Exchange.

Started purchasing.

Shell 1: [Miracle: Rain] × 2 (80,000 GP)

Shell 2: [Blessing: Fertile Soil] × 3 (120,000 GP)

Shell 3: [Miracle: Purify Water] × 5 (200,000 GP)

His capital drained to near-zero.

But ten miracles materialized in his dimensional vault.

Voros watched the holographic interface with fascination. "Where are you sourcing these?"

"Proprietary supply chain," Victor said. "Need-to-know basis."

"Fair enough."

Victor scheduled the delivery. Guild caravans. Dimensional transfer. Forty-eight-hour window.

Then a new message arrived.

From Lady Cassia.

> Victor,
>
> Church paladins raided three estates today. Confiscated grain reserves. Arrested stewards for "heresy."
>
> If miracles don't arrive in 48 hours, Coalition fractures. Revolution dies.
>
> No pressure.
>
> -C

Victor closed the message.

Looked at the ten miracles queued for delivery.

At the 51,030 GP remaining in his balance.

At the twenty-seven days left on his Consortium deadline.

And the Court Summons sitting on the desk.

> **[ARMI - Threat Convergence]**
> **Active Threats:**
> - Church Summons (5 days)
> - Coalition Deadline (48 hours)
> - Consortium Goal (869,970 GP remaining in 27 days)
> **Recommendation:** Prioritize Coalition delivery; defer Church negotiation

Victor cracked his knuckles.

"Voros. Execute delivery. I'll handle the Church."

"And the summons?"

"I'll attend. But not as a defendant."

Voros frowned. "What do you mean?"

Victor smiled.

"I'm bringing a counter-offer."
