Victor tapped the air, calling up the ARMI interface. The golden-black grid flickered into life, a Bloomberg-esque terminal reflected in his tired pupils. 

"ARMI," he whispered. "Draft a standard [Guardian’s Pact]. CSO designation. Tier 1 security clearance. Clause 47-B for non-lethal engagement incentives. Signing bonus: 10 GP equivalent in processed mana."

A scroll of translucent light manifested between them. It wasn't paper; it was a complex web of legal-geometric symbols that hummed with binding magic.

"Your thumb," Victor said, pointing to the blank space at the bottom of the glowing document. "It won't hurt. It just... synchronizes your intent with the dungeon's core logic."

Asterion didn't hesitate. He pressed his massive, calloused thumb against the light. 

> **[ARMI]**
> **Signature Verified**.
> **CONTRACT SIGNED**: [Succession Protocol 1.1 Initialized]
> **New Employee Registered**: [Asterion - CSO]

"Welcome to the team, General," Victor said, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders that he hadn't realized was there. "Sniv, bring him a clipboard. A large one. And find something that looks like an ID badge. We have standards to maintain."

Sniv, who had been watching from the rafters with a mixture of awe and sheer terror, practically tumbled down. "Yes, Boss! Big clipboard! Shiny badge! Sniv gets special badge too?"

"In time, Sniv. In time."

Asterion looked at his hands, then at the glowing sword still embedded in the stone of Floor Three. He looked... different. Still a monster, still a titan of muscle and horn, but the existential haze that had clouded his eyes for two centuries had cleared. He had a task. He had a title. 

**"And the flesh... I mean, the 'clients'?"** Asterion asked, his voice losing its predatory edge and gaining a professional curiosity. **"When do they return?"**

"Sooner than you think," Victor said, checking his perimeter notifications. "Now that the Silver Lance has fled, the rumor of a 'Hidden Boss' will be circulating through Oakhaven by sunset. The 'Glow-stick Sword' wasn't enough, but a Minotaur roar? That’s a Tier 4 marketing campaign."

Suddenly, the ARMI ticker at the edge of his vision began to scroll rapidly in Alert Red.

> **[ARMI]**
> **New Perimeter Alert**.
> **Entity Detected**: [The Iron Wolves]
> **Classification**: Veteran Party (Silver-Rank)
> **Threat Assessment**: CRITICAL (Level 18-22)
> **Status**: Entering Ruins.

Victor’s heart skipped a beat. This wasn't the slow, steady build-up he’d hoped for. This was market acceleration. The Iron Wolves—one of Oakhaven’s heavy hitters—had ignored the rumors and come to verify the 'Boss' themselves.

"They're here already," Victor whispered, a grin spreading across his face despite the sudden spike in danger. He looked up at Asterion. "CSO, take your position on Floor Four. Actually, no. Let’s change the choreography. I want them to reach Floor Three before they hear the first roar. I want them to feel the 'High-Stakes' environment."

Asterion nodded, his horns catching the dim dungeon light. **"I will prepare the 'Client Evaluation,' Manager."**

"Good," Victor said, stepping back into the shadows. "Let’s show them why this startup is worth the investment."
