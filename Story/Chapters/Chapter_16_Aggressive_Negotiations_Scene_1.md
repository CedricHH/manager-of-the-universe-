# Chapter 16: Aggressive Negotiations

Victor Kaine stared up at eight hundred pounds of prehistoric muscle and wondered if his life insurance policy would cover "liquidation by minotaur."

Asterion did not look like he was in the mood for a PowerPoint presentation. His nostrils flared, venting puffs of hot, humid steam that smelled of old stone and raw iron. The Minotaur’s hand was wrapped around the hilt of a double-headed axe that looked like it had been carved from a meteor. 

"The clock strikes, little Manager," Asterion rumbled. The sound didn't just vibrate in the air; it vibrated in Victor's marrow. "The 'business plan' better be edible. Because I am currently considering a raw meat diet."

Victor adjusted his tattered collar. His heart was hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird, but his face remained a mask of professional boredom. He had faced down billionaire board members who wanted to erase his existence for a 2% dividend increase. This was just a larger, hairier version of the same transaction.

"First," Victor said, his voice ringing with a crisp, analytical clarity that even he didn't quite feel. "We need to address your current performance metrics. I’ve initialized a review."

Asterion’s brow—massive and ridged with bone—furrowed in genuine confusion. "Per-for-mance? Metrics? You speak in riddles, human."

"I speak in math," Victor countered. He tapped his vision edge, activating a skill he hadn’t used in this capacity before.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Skill Activated**: [Performance Review]
> **Target**: Asterion (Boss-Class)
> **Level**: 20
> **Tenure**: 247 Years
> **Status**: Distressed Stakeholder / Critical Ennui

Victor felt the rush of data. It flooded his mind—stats, history, psychological pressure points. It was like reading a spreadsheet that breathed.

"Two hundred and forty-seven years," Victor said, pacing a three-foot line in front of the beast. "That’s how long you’ve been standing in that basement on Floor Four. Correct?"

Asterion paused, his grip on the axe loosening by a microscopic margin. "I have guarded the Core since the First Awakening. That is my purpose."

"Guarded it from what? A few stray slimes? The occasional party of farmhands with rusty pitchforks?" Victor gestured toward the stairs where the Silver Lance had just vanished. "In two hundred and forty-seven years, how many times have you been promoted?"

"Promoted?" Asterion repeated. The word sounded foreign in his mouth.

"Befördert," Victor translated, using the archaic term. "Moved to a higher position. Given more territory. Given better equipment."

"I am the Boss of Floor Four," Asterion said, his voice gaining a defensive edge. "There is no higher."

"Wrong," Victor snapped. "There is the whole world. There is Regional Management. There is Chief Security Officer. But instead, you’ve spent two and a half centuries in a windowless room, killing 1,847 people. Do you even remember their names?"

Asterion’s red eyes narrowed. "I remember their blood. Their screams. It is... enough."

"Is it?" Victor stopped pacing and looked the Minotaur directly in the eye. "Because my analysis says you’re bored. You didn't come up here for gold, Asterion. You came up here because you wanted something to happen. Anything. You wanted to see if the Manager would finally do something different."

Victor took a step closer, well within the reach of that massive axe. 

"You aren't a Boss," Victor whispered. "You're a tenant. And you’re being underpaid for your lease."
