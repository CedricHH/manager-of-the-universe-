# Chapter 91: The Premium Client

Desperate people paid premium prices.

Victor stared at the message on the Galactic Exchange hologram:

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** Urgent delivery requested. Will pay DOUBLE for immediate transfer.

Ninety thousand gold.

For a miracle he'd bought for five thousand.

ROI: 1,700%.

"Barnaby!" Victor called toward the driver's compartment.

"Yes, Boss?"

"The southern provinces drought. How bad is it?"

There was a pause. The sound of reins, hooves, the rumble of forty-two sellswords marching in escort formation around the caravan.

"Bad, Boss. Seven months now. Church rain blessings used to work ninety percent of the time. Now? Maybe sixty-five percent. Nobles are losing harvests. Peasants are getting restless. Governors are sweating."

Victor tapped his pen against the notebook.

Sixty-five percent success rate meant the Church's divine connection was *weakening*. Or the gods were charging more. Either way, supply was failing to meet demand.

Classic market inefficiency.

He typed a response:

> **[USER_7749]:** I accept 90,000 GP. But I need payment guarantee + buyer identity verification.

The reply came thirty seconds later.

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** Payment secured via Mana Lock. Identity... negotiable. How soon can you deliver?

Victor checked the caravan's position. ARMI overlaid a map in his peripheral vision. Two days to Oakhaven at current speed.

But the Exchange had a faster option.

> **[USER_7749]:** 48 hours. Oakhaven Waypoint. Take it or leave it.

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** ACCEPTED. Uploading payment now.

A progress bar appeared. 100%.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Escrow Locked:** 90,000 GP
> **Status:** Pending Delivery
> **Buyer Location Request:** APPROVED

Victor frowned. He opened the Exchange's premium services menu.

Most users never saw this tab. It required Reputation Tier 1 or higher. But there was one service available to all sellers: **Instant Transfer**.

> **[Instant Transfer]**
> **Function:** Deliver item directly to buyer without Waypoint retrieval
> **Fee:** 10% of sale price
> **Requirement:** Buyer physical location coordinates

Victor did the math.

- Sale: 90,000 GP
- Transfer fee: -9,000 GP
- Anonymity Shield (hide seller identity): -5,000 GP
- Escrow Insurance (2%): -1,800 GP
- **Net Profit: 74,200 GP**

Still a 1,384% return on the original 5,000 GP investment.

He selected all three premium options.

The buyer's location appeared: **Lady Cassia's Estate, Southern Borderlands.**

Victor ran an ARMI cross-reference.

> **[Entity Database]**
> **Name:** Lady Cassia Greymantle
> **Title:** Minor Noble (Baroness)
> **Estate Value:** 200,000 GP
> **Political Importance:** Low
> **Current Status:** Drought-affected region

Victor paused.

A minor noble with a 200k GP estate was paying 90k GP—*forty-five percent of her total wealth*—for a single rain miracle.

That wasn't desperation.

That was *crisis*.

He initiated the transfer.

***

The [Miracle: Rain] dematerialized from Victor's dimensional vault in a shimmer of golden light. ARMI tracked its journey—through dimensional nodes, across the Exchange's courier network, materializing fifteen minutes later at the coordinates.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Delivery Status:** CONFIRMED
> **Buyer Verification:** COMPLETE
> **Payment Releasing:** In Progress...

The escrow unlocked.

> **[Transaction Complete]**
> **Sale Price:** 90,000 GP
> **Fees:** -15,800 GP
> **Net Profit:** 74,200 GP
> **New Balance:** 130,930 GP
> **Reputation:** 3/10 Transactions Complete

Victor leaned back in his chair. 130,000 GP. Still short of the 1,000,000 GP goal, but progress.

Seven more transactions to unlock Tier 1. Then he could create shell companies. Hide his mana signature. Scale the operation.

A new message appeared.

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** Miracle verified. Payment releasing. Thank you.

Victor typed:

> **[USER_7749]:** Pleasure doing business. Future orders welcome.

There was a longer pause this time.

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** ...May I ask where you source these? The Church charges 120,000 and delivers failures.

Victor's fingers hovered over the holographic keyboard.

This was the pivot point.

He could:
- Ignore the question (safe, no commitment).
- Offer vague reassurance (maintain leverage).
- Propose long-term partnership (risk exposure, gain repeat customer).

He chose option three.

> **[USER_7749]:** Proprietary supply chain. If you need volume pricing, I offer discounts for bulk contracts.

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** Define "volume."

> **[USER_7749]:** 5+ miracles, pre-paid, 10% discount per item. Delivery guaranteed within one week.

Another long pause.

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** ...I represent 14 estates. Drought affects us all. Can you supply that volume?

Victor froze.

Fourteen estates.

If each needed five miracles minimum, that was seventy miracles total.

His current inventory: One [Blessing: Fertile Soil].

His weekly purchase limit on the Exchange: 25,000 GP.

At current prices, he could buy maybe five or six miracles per week. It would take twelve to fourteen weeks to fulfill an order of seventy.

And he had thirty days total.

The math didn't work.

Unless...

Victor opened a new calculation window.

**Option A: Accept Full Contract**
- Revenue: ~630,000 GP (14 estates × avg 5 miracles × discount rate)
- Timeline: 12-14 weeks
- Problem: Exceeds Consortium deadline

**Option B: Decline + Small Order**
- Revenue: 90-180k GP (1-2 estates)
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks
- Problem: Miss massive opportunity

**Option C: Partial Commitment + Staged Delivery**
- Revenue: 180k GP immediate (2 estates)
- Revenue: 450k GP deferred (12 estates, post-deadline)
- Timeline: Manageable
- Risk: Reveal arbitrage model to competitors via volume demand

He typed carefully.

> **[USER_7749]:** I can supply 2 estates immediately (10 miracles total). Remaining 12 estates on rolling 4-week delivery schedule. First delivery proves reliability. Then we negotiate long-term partnership.

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** Acceptable. Which 2 estates receive priority?

> **[USER_7749]:** Highest distress / political importance. Send me estate profiles.

> **[ANONYMOUS_BUYER]:** Uploading now. One condition: absolute anonymity. The Church cannot know our source.

Victor's eyes narrowed.

"Cannot know our source."

Not "shouldn't" or "we'd prefer they didn't."

*Cannot.*

A file appeared in the Exchange interface.

> **[Estate Profiles - Southern Coalition]**
> **Properties:** 14
> **Combined Value:** 2,800,000 GP
> **Political Affiliation:** [ENCRYPTED]

Victor opened the first profile.

**Lady Cassia Greymantle:**
- Estate Value: 200,000 GP
- Crop Failure Rate: 85%
- Peasant Unrest: HIGH
- Church Tithes: 40% of remaining yield
- Political Stance: [REDACTED - Coalition Member]

He scrolled to the second.

**Lord Harkin Vale:**
- Estate Value: 240,000 GP
- Crop Failure Rate: 90%
- Church Tithes: 45%
- Political Stance: [REDACTED]

Every profile was the same. Drought. Crop failure. Church tithes consuming what little remained.

And every single one had the same notation: **Political Stance: [REDACTED].**

Victor closed the file.

Opened his ledger.

Wrote two words: **Shadow Rebellion.**

They weren't buying miracles to save crops.

They were buying *independence*.

If they controlled their own rain—through Victor, not the Church—they didn't need Church blessings. No blessings meant no Church leverage. No leverage meant they could stop paying tithes.

Stop paying tithes long enough, and the Church lost its hold on the southern provinces entirely.

Victor had just sold a miracle to a revolution.

"Boss."

Kade's voice cut through Victor's analysis.

Victor looked up from the hologram. "What?"

Kade pointed out the caravan window.

Three riders. Armored. White cloaks with gold trim—the Church of Eternal Light's colors. They rode parallel to the caravan, fifty meters out, matching speed exactly.

Paladins. Level 18 minimum, based on the quality of their enchanted plate armor.

Victor activated `[Performance Review]` on the lead rider.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Target:** Paladin-Commander Theron
> **Level:** 20
> **Class:** Holy Avenger
> **Affiliation:** Church of Eternal Light (Inquisitorial Division)
> **Threat Assessment:** EXTREME

The lead paladin raised a gauntleted hand.

His voice boomed, amplified by divine magic.

"**Halt for inspection! Church of Eternal Light, authorized audit! Imperial Highway jurisdiction!**"

Victor closed the Exchange hologram. Looked at Kade.

"Win probability?"

Kade glanced out the window. Counted. "Three paladins, all high-level. Versus us? Maybe twelve percent. If we're lucky."

"And if we run?"

"They declare us fugitives. Church has jurisdiction on Imperial roads. We'd be outlaws by sundown."

Victor tapped his pen.

**Option A:** Stop. Let them audit. Risk: They find Exchange evidence.

**Option B:** Run. Become fugitives. Risk: Lose access to roads, cities, Waypoints.

**Option C:** Negotiate. Stall. Risk: Unknown.

He stood. Walked to the caravan door.

"Victor," Kade warned. "They're *Inquisitors*. They don't negotiate."

"Everyone negotiates," Victor said. "They just don't know it yet."

He opened the door. Stepped out onto the road.

The caravan slowed. Stopped.

From the driver's bench, Barnaby's voice: "Boss, are we being arrested? Because I'd like to update my resume if we're becoming fugitives."

"Not yet," Victor called back.

The three paladins approached. Their armor gleamed in the afternoon sun. Holy symbols burned faintly on their breastplates—

detection wards.

If Victor had contraband, cursed items, or active dark magic, those wards would flare.

The Galactic Exchange card in his pocket pulsed once.

Victor's hand twitched toward it.

The lead paladin dismounted. Theron. His face was scarred, his eyes cold. He looked like a man who'd burned heretics and slept well afterward.

"Name," Theron said. Not a question. A command.

"Victor Kaine. Independent consultant."

"Consultant." Theron's lip curled. "We've received reports of *unregistered divine commerce* on this route. Miracles sold without Church authorization. You know anything about that?"

Victor kept his expression neutral. "I'm not in the miracle business. I'm in logistics."

"Logistics." Theron stepped closer. His detection ward pulsed brighter. "Then you won't mind if we inspect your cargo."

Victor glanced at the Gilded Caravan. At Kade and his forty-two sellswords, who were *very carefully* not reaching for weapons.

At the obsidian card in his pocket, which contained evidence of three Galactic Exchange transactions.

At the 130,000 GP in his ledger—most of it from selling a miracle the Church didn't know existed.

He looked back at Theron.

And smiled.

"Gentlemen," Victor said. "I assume this is about the miracles?"

Theron's hand went to his sword hilt.

"Among other things," the paladin said quietly. "You're coming with us."
