# Chapter 72: The Preparation

Two days until the Church audit.

Victor sat at his desk, reviewing compliance documentation for the third time.

Outside his office window, the second Ember Trials was underway—fifteen parties registered, thirty-four spectators packed into the viewing room, revenue climbing steadily.

But the numbers no longer mattered.

High Priestess Aurelia was coming.

And she wasn't coming to inspect.

She was coming to destroy.

***

**The Morning Briefing**

Asterion stood by the door, arms crossed, his massive frame blocking most of the light.

Sniv perched on a chair, furiously scribbling notes.

Valerius leaned against the wall, expression grim.

Zip organized stacks of ledgers on the side table.

Victor addressed them without preamble.

"Status."

Valerius spoke first. "Aurelia's delegation arrives in two days. Three Paladins, two Church Auditors, and the High Priestess herself."

Sniv's ears drooped. "Boss... that many?"

"It's not an inspection," Valerius continued. "It's an inquisition. They're looking for any excuse to shut us down."

Victor pulled up an ARMI interface.

\u003e **[ARMI]**
\u003e Audit Preparation Status
\u003e Documents: 750 pages (100% regulatory compliant)
\u003e Vulnerabilities: 0 code violations detected
\u003e Risk Level: MODERATE (political/religious pressure)
\u003e Recommendation: Prepare contingency—[Public Support Protocol]

He leaned back.

"Then we don't give them one."

Asterion grunted. "You think perfect paperwork will stop a zealot?"

"No," Victor said. "But it forces her to either accept compliance or reveal her true motive—political suppression."

He gestured to the window.

Below, adventurers lined up for tournament registration.

"The Ember Trials aren't just revenue. They're visibility. If Aurelia shuts down Oakhaven's favorite new entertainment, she'll face public backlash."

Sniv looked up, hopeful. "So... we safe?"

Victor's expression didn't change.

"We're prepared. That's different."

***

Zip presented the master ledger—every transaction since the dungeon's founding, organized and cross-referenced.

Valerius added, "Safety inspections passed. Employee contracts formalized. Even the mosquito farm has a breeding license."

Victor allowed himself a thin smile. "Weaponized transparency."

Asterion raised an eyebrow. "Explain."

"If our operations are flawless on paper, Aurelia can't cite violations. If they're public—watched by nobles and journalists—she can't shut us down without political cost."

Victor closed the ledger. "We're not fighting the Church with force. We're fighting them with witnesses."

Sniv tilted his head. "But Boss... rules don't always matter."

Victor met his gaze. "That's why we're not relying on rules alone. We're relying on the forty people downstairs who'll tell their friends the Church destroyed their entertainment for no reason."

He stood. "Dismissed. Valerius, hourly updates on Aurelia. Asterion, double security. Zip, duplicate records."

The team filed out.

Victor returned to the window.

Below, the tournament continued.

***

**The Second Tournament**

The viewing room was packed—thirty-four spectators including adventurers studying tactics, merchants networking, nobles seeking entertainment, and five journalists from the Oakhaven Broadsheet.

On screen, "Iron Resolve" faced Ignatia in Phase One.

The dragon unleashed **Flame Torrent**.

The party's tank barely held the line.

Spectators gasped, cheered, critiqued.

"Should've brought fire resistance potions!"

"The healer's positioning is terrible!"

"Ten gold says they wipe before Phase Two!"

Victor watched from the back, calculating.

**Fifteen parties × 50 GP = 750 GP entry fees.**

**Thirty-four spectators × 50 GP = 1,700 GP.**

\u003e **[ARMI]**
\u003e Ember Trials - Week 1, Day 2
\u003e Revenue: 750 GP (Entries) + 1,700 GP (Spectators) = 2,450 GP
\u003e Costs: 500 GP (Prize) + 50 GP (Operations) = 550 GP
\u003e **Net Profit: 1,900 GP**
\u003e Week 1 Total (2 days): 3,100 GP profit

On screen, Iron Resolve reached 70% boss health.

Ignatia's wings ignited. **Phase Two.**

Their archer tried a net shot. It failed.

**Meteor Dive.** The healer died instantly.

The party retreated, bloodied. The crowd reacted with mixed disappointment and respect.

Then Silver Lance entered—the professional party from Chapter 15.

Captain Thorne led them, determined.

The viewing room erupted. "Silver Lance! They're legends!"

Victor's lips curled slightly. They'd come back.

***

**Silver Lance's Challenge**

The viewing room erupted when the leaderboard displayed their name.

"Silver Lance! They're legends!"

"Thorne's crew has cleared the Dragon's Maw dungeon three times!"

"This is going to be good."

On screen, Thorne addressed Ignatia with professional calm.

"We're here for the record, dragon. Let's see what you've got."

Ignatia grinned.

"**AT LAST. WORTHY CHALLENGERS.**"

The fight was clinical. Thorne's team moved with practiced precision.

They forced Ignatia through Phase One in twelve minutes.

Phase Two triggered. Aerial assault.

Lysa, their healer, called wind patterns. "Diving left in three... two... NOW!"

They scattered. **Meteor Dive** missed.

Their mage flash-froze Ignatia's wings. She crashed.

Thorne shield-bashed her jaw. **Stun.** Damage poured in.

At 40% health: **Phase Three.**

"ULTIMATE!" Lysa screamed.

**INFERNO BURST.**

They stacked behind Thorne's shield and Lysa's barrier. The explosion went off. The shield held—barely.

Thorne's HP: 34/200.

But they had no mana left.

Ignatia's **Tail Swipe** caught two party members. Both down.

Her **Flame Breath** finished them. **Total wipe at 28% boss health.**

***

The crowd was silent for three seconds.

Then someone started clapping.

Then everyone.

"They got her to Phase Three!"

"That's closer than anyone except Crimson Blades!"

"Silver Lance ALMOST had it!"

Victor updated the leaderboard:

\u003e **EMBER TRIALS - LEADERBOARD**
\u003e
\u003e 1. Crimson Blades - **VICTORY** - 24:17
\u003e 2. Silver Lance - **FAILED (28% HP remaining)** - 26:34
\u003e 3. Iron Hammers - **FAILED** - 18:42

Thorne emerged from the dungeon twenty minutes later, battered and frustrated.

He walked straight to Victor.

"We're coming back," Thorne said quietly. "Next week. We'll beat Crimson Blades' time."

Victor's expression was unreadable.

"I'm counting on it."

Thorne left.

Victor made a mental note: *The tournament isn't just revenue. It's insurance.*

When Aurelia tried to shut him down, forty spectators—including five journalists—would remember that the Church destroyed something they loved.

Public opinion was a weapon.

And Victor was about to arm it.

***

**Late Evening**

Victor sat alone, reviewing documents one final time.

Section 14: **Ethical Conduct of Dungeon Administrators**.

\u003e *"Has the administrator ever engaged in conduct that prioritizes external benefit over personal survival?"*

The phrasing stopped him. Corporate ethics training. Earth. Years ago.

The memory surfaced.

***

**Flashback: Three Days After the Leak**

His apartment. Chicago. 11:47 PM.

Victor sat reading the news:

\u003e **"Board of Directors Indicted in Mining Scandal. Whistleblower Evidence Leads to Charges."**

Forty-seven families would get justice. The cost: his life.

Survival probability: **11%**.

The doorbell rang.

Victor closed the laptop.

He stood, walked to the door, and looked through the peephole.

Two men in suits.

Professional.

Clean.

Not police.

He knew what they were.

Victor unlocked the door.

Opened it.

The taller man smiled—polite, empty.

"Mr. Kaine. We need to talk."

Victor's voice was calm.

"I assumed you would."

He stepped aside.

They entered.

The door closed behind them.

***

**Present**

Victor's hand trembled—just once—before he steadied it.

He closed the ethics document.

The flashback faded.

But the weight remained.

He'd died once for doing the right thing.

The Church wanted to find a weakness.

They didn't know he'd already paid that price.

A knock at the door.

Valerius entered, expression tense.

"Boss. Problem."

Victor looked up.

"Define 'problem.'"

"The Church delegation just arrived in Oakhaven."

Victor frowned. "They're two days early."

"I know. Aurelia sent a message. She's invoking 'emergency inspection authority.' She's coming here. Tonight."

Victor stood.

"How long?"

"Thirty minutes."

Victor pulled up an ARMI interface, fingers moving rapidly.

"Wake the team. I want every document ready. Every record accessible. Asterion at the entrance. Zip in the archive room."

"Boss... she's not following protocol. This is—"

"A power play," Victor finished. "She wants to catch us unprepared."

He grabbed his coat.

"Unfortunately for her, I'm always prepared."

***

**The Arrival**

Twenty-eight minutes later, High Priestess Aurelia arrived at the dungeon entrance.

She wore white-and-gold ceremonial robes, a sun medallion glinting at her throat.

Three Paladins flanked her—Roland among them, looking conflicted.

Two Church Auditors carried ledgers and quills.

Asterion stood at the entrance, arms crossed, impassive.

Aurelia's voice was cold.

"Step aside, creature. I'm here on Church business."

Asterion didn't move.

"Dungeon Administrator Kaine has been notified. He'll meet you inside."

Aurelia's eyes narrowed.

"I don't need an invitation."

"Then you won't mind waiting thirty seconds for him to arrive," Asterion said calmly.

Victor emerged from the stairwell, expression neutral.

"High Priestess. Welcome. I wasn't expecting you for another two days."

Aurelia's smile was sharp.

"Surprise inspections are within Church authority. Surely you have no objections?"

"None," Victor said. "All records are available for review. When would you like to begin?"

"Now."

Victor gestured toward the interior.

"The archive room is this way. However—"

He paused, glancing toward the viewing room.

"—the late-night exhibition match is currently in progress. Forty-two spectators. You're welcome to join them, if you'd like to see what the dungeon offers Oakhaven."

Aurelia's expression didn't change.

"I'm here to inspect compliance, not entertainment."

"Of course," Victor said. "But you'll pass through the viewing room on the way to the archives. It's unavoidable."

He led her inside.

***

**The Viewing Room**

Aurelia entered the packed room. Forty-two spectators sat transfixed by the screens—nobles, merchants, families watching a party fight Ignatia.

The crowd erupted. "DODGE LEFT!" "HEAL THE TANK!"

Aurelia stopped, scanning the room. She saw Lord Carven (influential noble), Guildmaster Voros Thane, three journalists, families with children eating snacks.

This wasn't a dark dungeon. This was entertainment infrastructure.

On screen, the party defeated Ignatia. The crowd applauded.

Victor stood beside her. "The Ember Trials. Weekly tournament. Oakhaven's new favorite pastime."

Aurelia's jaw tightened. "Spectacle doesn't excuse regulatory violations."

"Agreed," Victor said. "Which is why we maintain perfect compliance. Shall we proceed to the archives?"

Aurelia turned, robes sweeping. "Yes. Now."

***

Victor led her to the archive room—a converted storage chamber lined with filing cabinets and ledgers.

Zip stood waiting, clipboard in hand.

"High Priestess," Zip said flatly. "All records organized by category. Financial, operational, employee contracts, safety inspections. What you need?"

Aurelia's eyes scanned the room.

Hundreds of documents.

Perfectly organized.

She turned to Victor.

"I want every transaction from the past month. Every contract. Every employee agreement."

Victor nodded.

"Zip will assist you. Everything is cross-referenced and dated."

Aurelia's eyes narrowed.

"You seem very prepared for this."

Victor's expression remained neutral.

"I've been audited before, High Priestess. I learned to keep excellent records."

He gestured to the cabinets.

"Take your time. If you need clarification on anything, Valerius is available."

Aurelia's gaze lingered on him for a long moment.

Then she turned to her auditors.

"Begin with financial records. I want discrepancies identified by morning."

Victor left the room.

***

**The Office**

Alone again.

The memory returned—stronger this time.

unavoidable.

***

**Flashback: The Apartment (Continued)**

The two men sat on his couch.

Victor remained standing.

The taller one spoke first.

"The board is very disappointed, Victor."

"I'm sure they are," Victor said.

The shorter man opened a briefcase.

Inside: a syringe.

"This can be easy," the taller man said. "Heart attack. Tragic. Stress-related. No one will question it."

Victor's voice was calm.

"And if I resist?"

"Then it's messy. We'd prefer easy."

Victor considered.

He'd already won.

The evidence was out.

The board would fall.

Forty-seven families would get justice.

His survival was... irrelevant.

"ROI positive," he murmured.

The taller man frowned. "What?"

Victor looked at him.

"Nothing. Proceed."

The shorter man stood, syringe in hand.

Victor didn't resist.

The needle entered his arm.

The liquid was cold.

His vision blurred.

The last thing he saw: the two men, standing, watching him collapse.

The last thing he thought: *Worth it.*

***

**Present**

Victor's hand gripped the desk edge, knuckles white.

The flashback faded.

Slowly.

He exhaled.

\u003e **[ARMI - ALERT]**
\u003e Memory Integration: 92% complete
\u003e Psychological Impact: Moderate
\u003e Recommendation: Rest advised

Victor ignored the warning.

He pulled up the audit schedule.

Aurelia would spend the night combing through records.

She wouldn't find violations.

But she'd find something else.

EveryTransaction.  
Every decision.  
Every calculated risk.

She'd see a pattern.

A man who optimizes everything.

A man without empathy.

A man who treats people as assets.

Victor stared at the projection.

The Church wanted to find a weakness.

They would find something worse.

They'd find a man who'd already died once for a principle.

And principles, Victor had learned, were far more dangerous than greed.

***

**STATUS**: Church audit initiated (2 days early). Aurelia reviewing records. Ember Trials Day 2: 2,450 GP revenue, 1,900 GP profit. Flashback triggered: "Worth It" moment (assassination scene). Victor preparing for confrontation. Compliance perfect, but Aurelia seeking non-regulatory angle.
