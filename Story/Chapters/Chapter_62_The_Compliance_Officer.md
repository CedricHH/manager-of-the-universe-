# Chapter 62: The Compliance Officer

The morning sun hit the entrance of Insolvia Holdings, illuminating the fresh coat of paint, the polite signage ("Please Wipe Your Boots"), and the seven-foot-tall heavily armored zealot blocking the driveway.

Victor adjusted his cufflinks and stepped out onto the porch. It was Day One of the Royal Charter. It was supposed to be a celebration.

Instead, it felt like a prison visit.

The Paladin stood perfectly still. He wore the white-and-gold plate of the Eternal Light, polished to a blindness-inducing shine. A massive two-handed hammer rested head-down on the cobblestones. Above him, the [Mark of the Watcher] glowed in the sky like a neon "Do Not Enter" sign.

"Good morning," Victor called out cheerfully. "Can I offer you some coffee? We have a dark roast imported from the Fire Lands. Low acidity, high caffeine."

The Paladin—Sir Roland, according to the scary aura reading—didn't blink. He didn't turn his head.

"I do not drink with Heretics," Roland said. His voice sounded like gravel grinding against a tombstone.

"Technically, I am a Royal Charter Holder," Victor corrected. "Which makes me a government contractor. You're being rude to a civil servant."

Roland turned slowly. His helmet was T-shaped, hiding his eyes, but Victor could feel the judgment radiating through the metal.

"You are a stain," Roland said casually. "I am here to watch you fade."

"Fade?" Victor checked his watch. "Actually, I'm planning to scale. Doors open in ten minutes."

"We shall see who enters," Roland said.

**09:00 AM - Opening Time**

Usually, there was a line. The "Morning Rush" of low-level grinders wanting to snag the easy spawns before breakfast.

Today, there was a crowd... but they were standing fifty feet away, whispering.

"Is that a *Lightbringer*?"
"Why is the Church here?"
"Did the dungeon get purged?"
"I'm not going in there. If he marks me, I can't get healing at the Temple."

Victor stood by the reception desk, watching the visitor counter.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Current Visitors**: 0.
> **Revenue**: 0 GP.
> **Status**: [Boycotted].

"It's the intimidation factor," Valerius whispered, hiding behind a pile of tax forms. "Adventurers are superstitious. They think the Church is about to smite the place. Or worse, audit their loot."

"He's blocking my foot traffic," Victor muttered. "He's not physically stopping them, but he's acting like a scarecrow."

"Scarecrow works on crows," Sniv pointed out helpfully. "Adventurers are like crows. Shiny things! Caw caw!"

Victor looked at the goblin. Sniv was wearing a laminated badge that said **LICENSED COMPLIANCE ASSISTANT**. He looked very proud.

"You're right, Sniv," Victor said. "They are attracted to shiny things. And they are afraid of the dark. So..."

Victor walked out to the gate. He ignored Roland and walked straight to the hesitators.

"Citizens!" Victor boomed, activating his [Sales Voice] skill.

The crowd jumped. Roland tightened his grip on the hammer.

"I see you admiring our new security measures!" Victor gestured to the terrifying Paladin. "Top of the line! Insolvia Holdings is proud to announce our partnership with the Crown *and* the recognition of the Temple!"

"Recognition?" a thief shouted. "He called you a stain!"

"He called me a 'Person of Interest'," Victor lied smoothly. "Look at him! A Paladin of the Eternal Light! Guarding *your* dungeon! Do you know what this means?"

The crowd looked confused.

"It means this is the safest grind spot in the Kingdom!" Victor declared. "No PKers! No bandits! No surprise mimics! The Church and State guarantee your safety. Where else can you level up under the personal protection of a Lightbringer?"

Roland stiffened. "I do not protect them. I watch for corruption."

"Exactly!" Victor spun around. "He watches! He ensures *Fair Play*! If a monster cheats, he... well, he'll probably smite it! Right, Sir Roland?"

Roland made a noise that sounded like a boiler exploding.

"And to celebrate this new era of security," Victor added, dropping his voice to a conspiracy whisper. "We are offering the 'Penance Special'. 10% off entry fees for anyone who has... let's say... *spiritual burdens* they want to work off through honest combat."

"Valerius!" Victor snapped his fingers.

The accountant scrambled forward, frantically scribbling "10% OFF SIN" on scraps of parchment with a quill that was moving so fast it was smoking. He shoved the improvised coupons into the hands of the confused crowd.

"Here! Valid today only! Redeemable at the slime vat!" Valerius squeaked.

The crowd murmured. Safety was good. Discounts were better. Coupons were irresistible.

"Is it true the slimes drop gold now?" a warrior asked.

"Certified Royal Currency," Victor nodded.

A dwarf stepped forward. "If the Paladin doesn't squash me... I'll take a look."

The dwarf walked past Roland. The Paladin loomed. The Shadow of Judgment fell over the dwarf.
Roland didn't move.

The dwarf scurried inside.

"See?" Victor grinned. "Safe as houses."

Slowly, the trickle started. It wasn't the usual flood, but it was business.

**Noon - The Back Office**

"Revenue is at 60% of normal," Valerius reported. "Better than zero. But we lost the 'High Rollers'."

"The Necromancers?" Victor asked.

"And the Warlocks. The Assassins. Anyone with a bounty or a dark pact won't come within a mile of Roland. That's our premium clientele."

Victor sighed. "The Paladin is a filter. He filters out the darkness. Which is ironic, because that's usually where the money is."

"We need a new demographic," Valerius said. "Or we need to get rid of him."

"We can't get rid of him. If I touch him, Aurelia burns the mountain. We have to work around him. Or... utilize him."

Victor looked at the paperwork on his desk. The Royal Charter. The Tax Forms. The "Compliance Certificates."

"We are legitimate now, Valerius. We don't need criminals. We need *Institutions*."

There was a knock on the door. Not the frantic scratch of a goblin, but a solid, rhythmic rap. A courier.

"Enter," Victor said.

A man in a sharp grey suit walked in. He didn't look like an adventurer. He didn't look like a churchgoer. He looked like Valerius would look if Valerius had a soul made of double-entry bookkeeping.

"Mr. Kaine?" the man asked.

"Speaking."

"I represents the **Gilded Ledger of Oakhaven**."

Valerius gasped. "The Bank?"

"We received notice of your recent... liquidity event," the banker said, glancing at the Settlement Agreement pinned to the wall. "And your Royal Charter. The Bank is always interested in emerging markets."

He placed a heavy, cream-colored envelope on the desk.

"A Line of Credit," the banker said. "And an invitation to the Merchant's Ball. If you are truly 'legal', Mr. Kaine, it is time you stopped playing with swords and started playing with debt."

Victor looked at the letter. It felt heavier than a sword.

The Church wanted to audit him. The Kingdom wanted to tax him.
But the Bank? The Bank wanted to *leverage* him.

Victor smiled. It was the smile of a shark entering a school of tuna.

"Tell your masters," Victor said, "that I am very interested in discussing... ROI."

The banker nodded and left.

Victor turned to Valerius.

"We lost the Assassins," Victor said. "But I think we just found the Whales."

> **[ARMI]**
> **New Opportunity**: The Banking Sector.
> **Risk Level**: High (Financial Ruin).
> **Potential Reward**: Infinite Scaling.
> **Objective**: Secure the Loan.

"Roland can watch the door all he wants," Victor whispered. "Money doesn't use the front door."

**Status**: The compliance era has begun. And Victor just found a way to bypass the blockade.
