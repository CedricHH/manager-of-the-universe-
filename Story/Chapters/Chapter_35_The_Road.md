# Chapter 35: The Road

The ancient road to Oakhaven was a monument to deferred maintenance.

Victor walked at a steady pace optimized for distance, not speed. Business travel efficiency calibrated over two decades of conference circuits and airport terminals. The road beneath his boots was packed dirt with occasional cobblestones where someone had once cared about infrastructure. 

Those cobblestones were now cracked. Overgrown. Evidence of a civilization that had peaked and coasted on momentum.

His ARMI interface catalogued everything.

> **[ARMI - ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT]**
> Road Quality: 34% (Poor maintenance, drainage issues)
> Traffic Volume: Moderate (12 travelers/hour average)
> Infrastructure Investment: Minimal
> Observation: Transportation sector underutilized
> Opportunity: Logistics optimization potential

"One thing at a time," Victor muttered.

From the travel bag slung over his shoulder, a muffled voice squeaked: "Zip see trees! Very tall! Many trees! Zip count—"

Victor jostled the bag. "What did I say about quiet?"

The bag went silent save for aggrieved breathing.

The landscape stretched around him: dense forest transitioning to farmland, fields of grain interspersed with stretches of wilderness. Occasional ruins dotted the horizon—stone towers reclaimed by vines, collapsed walls suggesting settlements abandoned decades or centuries ago.

Resource misallocation. Territory management failure. Classic symptoms of extractive governance.

Victor filed it away.

Day one of travel passed without incident.

He encountered other travelers: farmers hauling produce toward Oakhaven's markets, pilgrims clutching prayer beads headed for some shrine Victor didn't care about, adventurer parties—young, eager, poorly equipped—moving toward the dungeon zones with the confidence of people who'd never seen a real boss monster.

None of them bothered him. A traveling merchant with a kobold assistant was unremarkable. Common.

Perfect.

Around midday, Victor stopped at a roadside rest station—a wooden shelter with benches and a communal well. Three merchant caravans had parked, drivers watering their pack animals and trading gossip.

Victor pulled Zip from the bag.

The kobold stretched dramatically, joints popping. "Zip cramped! Bag not ergonomic! Zip design better bag later!"

"Later," Victor confirmed. "Eat. Stay visible. Look like assistant."

He distributed rations while analyzing the other merchants. Professional intelligence gathering disguised as small talk.

An older trader with weather-beaten skin and calculating eyes noticed Victor's "merchandise"—the potion vials strapped to his pack in deliberate display.

The man approached.

"Those slime cores," he said without preamble. "Where'd you source them? Quality like that comes from managed dungeons, not wild harvesting."

Victor didn't miss a beat. "Private supplier. Exclusive contract."

"Exclusive." The merchant's eyes gleamed with the universal expression of someone smelling profit. "How exclusive?"

"Provisionally exclusive," Victor corrected. "I'm exploring expansion opportunities."

The man pulled a business card from his vest—actual formal documentation, embossed script on thick paper. **Merchant Guild Associate, Oakhaven Chapter**.

"Halric Voss," he introduced himself. "If you're ever interested in wholesale arrangements, I represent buyers who value quality over volume." He tapped one of Victor's vials. "Slime extract this pure? There's a market."

Victor pocketed the card. "I'll keep that in mind."

First surface contact established. Potential revenue stream identified. The trip was already paying dividends.

When Victor resumed travel, Zip scrambled back into the bag muttering about "networking" and "synergies."

---

Day two brought complications.

Victor crested a hill and saw it: a bridge spanning a river gorge, stone construction that suggested engineering competence from a previous era. The kind of infrastructure that should have been public utility.

It wasn't.

Lord Sterling's toll station squatted at the bridge entrance like a tick embedded in a transportation artery. Wooden fortifications, armed guards, and a queue of travelers grudgingly handing over coin.

Victor joined the line.

Six travelers ahead of him. He observed the transaction pattern: commoners paid 5 GP, merchants paid 10 GP, adventurers got harassed about dungeon permits before paying 15 GP.

Rent-seeking behavior disguised as legitimate governance. Classic feudal extraction model.

The line moved.

Victor reached the checkpoint. A guard—Level 12, decent equipment, bored expression of someone extracting tolls for the thousandth time—gestured him forward.

"Toll is 10 GP. Merchant rate."

"For a public road?" Victor kept his tone conversational. Curious, not challenging.

"Lord Sterling owns this bridge. His land, his rules." The guard's hand drifted toward his sword hilt. Not threatening, just... established protocol for dealing with complainers.

Victor paid without further comment. Ten Gold Pieces removed from his operating cash. Forty GP remaining.

But as he crossed, he analyzed.

The toll station was inefficient. Single checkpoint—no advance payment system, no receipts, no record-keeping beyond verbal accounting. The guards were well-equipped but unmotivated. The fortification was defensive, not optimized for throughput.

> **[ARMI - TARGET ANALYSIS: LORD STERLING]**
> Entity Type: Regional Noble
> Territory: Trade route monopoly (bridge control)
> Revenue Model: Toll extraction, land taxes
> Business Strategy: Extractive (rent-seeking, not value creation)
> Vulnerabilities: Infrastructure-dependent, labor-intensive, zero innovation
> Assessment: Vulnerable to competitive disruption

Victor filed this away with particular interest.

Lord Sterling ran his territory like a medieval hedge fund—maximum extraction, minimum investment. The kind of management Victor had seen destroy Fortune 500 companies through short-term thinking.

Which meant Lord Sterling had no idea how to compete with someone who understood operational efficiency.

Leverage identified.

---

An hour past the toll station, Victor confirmed he was being followed.

Two men. Professionals, not bandits. They maintained sixty-meter distance, matched his pace exactly, and communicated through hand signals when they thought he wasn't looking.

Victor didn't run. Running indicated guilt. Running triggered pursuit.

Instead, he walked another half-kilometer, identified a clearing with good sightlines, and stopped.

Turned.

Waited.

The men approached without attempting stealth. That was professional. Amateurs would have pretended coincidence.

Both were Level 9-10—adventurer-tier equipment, confident stance, hands near weapons but not drawn. The leader spoke:

"You. Merchant. Lord Sterling would like a word about your goods."

Victor maintained neutral posture. "I'm a simple trader."

"Those slime cores aren't simple." The man gestured to Victor's pack. "Premium grade. Dungeon-sourced. Where's your dungeon access permit?"

Victor paused.

Dungeon access permit. He hadn't known that was a requirement. Hadn't appeared in any of Nova's forged documentation.

Regulatory gap identified.

"I wasn't aware permits were required for finished goods," Victor said carefully. "The cores have been processed and certified for trade."

"Certified by whom?" The second man stepped sideways, flanking position. Not attacking, just... establishing tactical superiority.

Victor recalculated rapidly.

These weren't toll collectors. These were enforcers. Sterling's economic protection team—investigating competitors, identifying unregistered operations, protecting the lord's monopoly on dungeon access.

Smart. Inefficient, labor-intensive, but smart.

"The materials are legitimately sourced," Victor said. "I have seller documentation—"

"From an unlicensed dungeon." The leader's hand settled on his sword hilt. "That's illegal harvesting. Lord Sterling controls all dungeon rights in this territory. Anyone selling dungeon goods pays licensing fees or faces confiscation."

Ah.

Not law enforcement. **Protection racket.**

Victor had dealt with dozens of these on Earth. Union representatives who happened to know when OSHA would inspect. Consultants whose presence guaranteed smooth regulatory approvals. The only difference was the swords.

The math was simple: Lord Sterling monopolized dungeon access, taxed all dungeon-sourced trade, and used armed enforcers to eliminate competition.

Effective. Medieval. Vulnerable.

The first man drew his blade halfway. "Come quietly, or we take you by force. Lord Sterling has questions."

Victor ran the numbers.

Two opponents, Level 9-10. He was Level 1. Zip was useless in combat. [Aggressive Negotiations] cost 50 GP per second of active use. He had 40 GP total.

Options:
1. **Fight** - 98% chance of loss, 40 GP cost, high injury probability
2. **Negotiate from weakness** - Low success probability without leverage
3. **Surrender** - Gather intelligence, worst-case scenario
4. **Negotiate from strength** - Required leverage he didn't have

Unless.

Victor smiled.

"Before you decide to 'take me by force,'" Victor said calmly, "consider this."

He reached into his pack—slowly, carefully, telegraphing non-aggression—and withdrew a single mana crystal. Not the slime cores. One of the premium-grade crystals Nova had prepared from Floor 3 mining operations.

The thing glowed with concentrated magical energy. Worth 100 GP minimum in raw form. Worth significantly more to the right buyer.

"This," Victor said, holding it at eye level where both men could see, "is worth one hundred Gold Pieces. Unprocessed. I have access to more. Substantially more."

The men's eyes tracked the crystal.

"Now," Victor continued, voice shifting into the tone that had closed hostile merger negotiations and turned activist shareholders into allies, "you have a choice. You can drag a beaten merchant to Lord Sterling—damaged goods, negative value, waste of your time. Or..."

He pocketed the crystal.

"You can bring him a business opportunity. The kind that makes toll roads look like pocket change."

The leader's sword hand relaxed fractionally. "What kind of opportunity?"

Victor pulled the black card from his inner pocket. Not showing it—just flashing the edge. Consortium-grade materials. Impossible to forge. The kind of documentation that suggested serious backing.

"I represent resource access Lord Sterling doesn't currently have. Exclusive access. The slime cores you saw? Entry-level product. I'm headed to Oakhaven to formalize licensing agreements. Lord Sterling can either shut me down and make nothing... or take a meeting and discuss revenue-sharing arrangements."

It was a bluff wrapped in truth wrapped in calculated misdirection. Beautiful.

The second man glanced at his partner. "Boss said bring in anyone selling unregistered dungeon goods..."

"As criminals," the leader agreed. "Or as consultants. Our call how we deliver him."

Victor watched the calculation happen. These men worked on commission, probably. A dead or beaten merchant meant base salary. A profitable introduction to their lord meant bonuses.

Incentives. Always about incentives.

The leader sheathed his sword. "You come to Sterling Manor. As a **guest**. Under escort. If your 'opportunity' is legitimate, we discuss arrangements. If you're wasting his Lordship's time..."

He left the threat implicit.

"I never waste time," Victor said. "Especially not valuable people's time. Take me to Lord Sterling."

The men exchanged looks. Then nodded.

"This way. And keep your kobold quiet."

From the bag, Zip's voice squeaked: "Zip **very** quiet! Best quiet! Silent like—"

Victor jostled the bag.

Zip went silent.

Victor followed the armed escort toward Sterling Manor, toward whatever territorial noble controlled Oakhaven's economy, toward a negotiation he had approximately ninety minutes to prepare for.

Behind him: the dungeon, two days away, running on autopilot.

Ahead: Lord Sterling, local power broker, economic gatekeeper, and Victor's first real surface-world test.

And in his pocket: one black Consortium card, fifty Gold Pieces minus tolls, and the absolute certainty that Lord Sterling had no idea what kind of "merchant" just got escorted into his territory.

Victor smiled.

Let the audit begin.
