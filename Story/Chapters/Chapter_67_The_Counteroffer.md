# Chapter 67: The Counteroffer

Forty-eight hours.

That's how long it had been since Thaddeus Crow left the dungeon with Victor's loan proposal.

No response. No pigeon. No messenger.

Just silence.

Valerius circled Victor's office like a caged goblin, chewing on a quill. "This is bad, Boss. Silence is never good. Either they're preparing a counteroffer... or they're preparing a lawsuit."

Victor sat at his desk, watching the fifteen monitoring mosquitoes hovering outside his window. They pulsed with faint golden light, transmitting everything back to Malcom.

"They're not suing," Victor said calmly. "If Malcom wanted to call the loan, he'd have done it already. He's stalling because he's arguing with someone."

"Who?"

"His superiors. Malcom wants to punish me. But the Bank's board sees profit. Bureaucracy moves slowly when caught between fear and greed."

Val erius didn't look convinced.

Victor checked the time: 2:58 PM.

Then, at exactly 3:00 PM, a magical pigeon landed on the windowsill.

Victor opened the message.

But it wasn't from Malcom.

It was from **Bank of Sterling**.

---

> **Bank of Sterling**
> **Senior Directorate**
>
> Dear Mr. Kaine,
>
> We understand you are currently seeking expansion capital for Dungeon Insolvia. The Bank of Sterling would be delighted to discuss mutually beneficial terms.
>
> **Proposed Offer**:
> - Principal: 15,000 GP
> - Interest Rate: 4.0% APR
> - Term: 24 months
> - No surveillance clauses
> - No operational restrictions
>
> We believe in supporting innovative enterprises without unnecessary oversight.
>
> Respectfully,
> Lord Percival Sterling, Senior Director

---

Victor read it twice.

Then he smiled.

"The leak worked."

Valerius blinked. "Leak?"

"Crow told someone about my proposal. Probably not directly—auditors don't gossip—but someone at the Gilded Ledger talked. And Sterling heard."

"So... we have a second offer?"

"We have *competition*," Victor corrected.

Five minutes later, a second pigeon arrived.

This one had the Gilded Ledger's crest.

Victor opened it.

---

> **The Gilded Ledger**
> **Office of the Director**
>
> Mr. Kaine,
>
> Your proposal has been reviewed by the Board.
>
> **Approved with revised terms**:
> - Principal: 15,000 GP
> - Interest Rate: 4.5% APR
> - Term: 24 months
>
> **Additional Requirements**:
> 1. Weekly financial reporting (revised from monthly)
> 2. Bank retains veto rights on Floor 5 biome selection
> 3. Revenue share increased to 20% on Floor 5 (up from 12%)
> 4. Mandatory quarterly compliance audits
>
> **Decision window**: 24 hours. Offer expires if not accepted.
>
> We trust you will make the prudent choice.
>
> Director Malcom

---

Victor set both letters side by side.

Valerius leaned over. "Sterling's offer is better. Lower interest, no control clauses. Easy choice."

"Is it?" Victor asked.

He pulled up his mental interface.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Competing Offers Analysis**
>
> **Gilded Ledger**:
> - Interest: 4.5% APR
> - Control demands: HIGH (veto rights, revenue increase, audits)
> - Relationship: Hostile but established
> - Strategic motivation: Retaining client + asserting dominance
>
> **Bank of Sterling**:
> - Interest: 4.0% APR (BETTER)
> - Control demands: NONE
> - Relationship: New, untested
> - Strategic motivation: Stealing client from competitor
>
> **Concentration Risk Analysis**:
> - Existing Sterling partnership: 20% revenue share (Floors 1-4)
> - New Sterling loan: 15,000 GP debt
> - **Total Sterling exposure**: Financial + Operational leverage (DANGEROUS)

"The Sterling offer is financially better," Victor said. "But strategically risky."

"How?" Valerius asked.

"I already have a 20% revenue-sharing deal with Lord Sterling's family. If I take a loan from *Bank* of Sterling, I'm now dependent on them for cash flow *and* credit. If the Sterling family ever turns hostile, they can strangle me at two pressure points simultaneously."

Valerius paled. "That's... bad."

"That's concentrated risk," Victor corrected. "Which is only bad if I don't have alternatives."

He began drafting a response.

***

**The Counter-Counteroffer**

Victor wrote carefully, weighing every word.

---

> **To: Director Malcom**
>
> Director,
>
> I appreciate the Board's consideration. However, the revised terms are unacceptable.
>
> **Counterproposal**:
> - Interest: 4.5% APR (accepted)
> - Financial reporting: Monthly (industry standard, per original agreement)
> - Veto rights: Advisory input only (non-binding recommendations)
> - Revenue share: 12% on Floor 5 (consistent with Floors 1-4)
> - Audits: Semi-annual (sufficient for risk management)
>
> I remind you: I have competing offers. I suggest we find mutually beneficial terms rather than punitive ones.
>
> Respectfully,
> Victor Kaine

---

Valerius stared. "You're... *negotiating*? With the Bank?"

"They made demands," Victor said. "Which means they *want* this deal. Now it's just a question of pricing."

"What if they say no?"

"Then I go to Sterling."

"But you just said Sterling is risky—"

"It is. But Malcom doesn't know I think that. From his perspective, I have a better offer on the table. He has to match it or lose me."

Victor sealed the letter and attached it to a return pigeon.

Simultaneously, he drafted a second letter—to Bank of Sterling:

---

> **To: Lord Percival Sterling**
>
> Lord Sterling,
>
> Thank you for your generous offer. I am reviewing all available options and will respond within 48 hours.
>
> I appreciate your interest in Dungeon Insolvia.
>
> Victor Kaine

---

"Polite delay," Victor explained. "Keeps Sterling engaged without committing. And it tells Malcom I'm seriously considering leaving."

He sent both pigeons.

Valerius sat down heavily. "So now what?"

"Now we wait," Victor said.

"For what?"

"For Malcom to blink. Again."

***

**The Compromise**

Six hours later—9:00 PM, well past normal business hours—a pigeon arrived.

Malcom's response was terse.

---

> **Modified Terms** (Final Offer):
>
> - Principal: 15,000 GP
> - Interest: 4.5% APR
> - Reporting: Monthly (accepted)
> - Revenue share: 15% on Floor 5 only (compromise)
> - Audits: Annual, with reserved spot-check rights
> - Biome selection: Advisory review by Bank (non-binding)
>
> **Decision window**: 12 hours.
>
> This is our final position.
>
> —Malcom

---

Victor analyzed it.

**Gilded Ledger (Revised)**:
- Cost: 4.5% interest + 15% Floor 5 revenue (3% premium over current floors)
- Control: Minimal (advisory only, annual audits)
- Risk: Manageable

**Bank of Sterling (Standing Offer)**:
- Cost: 4.0% interest + no revenue increase
- Control: None
- Risk: Concentration (Sterling family exposure)

Victor ran the numbers.

The interest rate difference (0.5%) meant 75 GP extra per year with Gilded Ledger.

The revenue share difference (3%) on Floor 5 meant approximately 200 GP per year (assuming Floor 5 matched Floor 4's performance).

Total extra cost: ~275 GP/year with Gilded Ledger.

But the Sterling concentration risk? Potentially catastrophic if the relationship soured.

Victor could accept Gilded Ledger's offer. It was reasonable.

Or he could accept Sterling's offer. It was cheaper.

Then Victor realized something.

He didn't have to choose between two options.

He could create a third.

***

**The Market**

Victor drafted a new letter.

But not to Malcom.

And not to Sterling.

He addressed it to the **Merchant's Guild Bank**, the third-largest financial institution in Oakhaven.

---

> **To the Board of Directors, Merchant's Guild Bank**
>
> Gentlemen,
>
> I am Victor Kaine, Administrator of Dungeon Insolvia.
>
> I currently manage 9,500 GP in active credit with strong repayment history and zero defaults. My operation generates consistent revenue and has recently passed a hostile third-party audit with perfect compliance.
>
> I am seeking 15,000 GP in expansion capital for Floor 5 development.
>
> **Current competing offers**: 4.0% to 4.5% APR from established institutions.
>
> If the Merchant's Guild can offer competitive terms, I am open to preliminary discussions.
>
> This is a time-sensitive opportunity.
>
> Victor Kaine
> Administrator, Dungeon Insolvia

---

Valerius read it over Victor's shoulder.

His voice came out as a squeak. "Boss... you're creating a *three-way* bidding war?"

"No," Victor said calmly. "I'm creating a *market*. Banks compete when they think others are winning. The more options I have, the better my terms become."

"But the Merchant's Guild—they're primarily merchant financing, not dungeon loans—"

"Which means they're hungry for diversification. And I just told them two of their competitors are interested. They'll want in."

Victor sealed the letter and sent it via express courier.

"Now we sleep," Victor said.

"Sleep?!" Valerius yelped. "Malcom's offer expires in 12 hours!"

"Then Malcom can wait 11," Victor said.

***

**The Third Option**

Victor didn't sleep.

He spent the night running projections, analyzing risk matrices, and preparing negotiation fallbacks.

At 4:00 AM, a knock on the door.

An exhausted courier stood outside, holding a sealed letter embossed with the Merchant's Guild crest.

Victor tipped him 5 GP.

He opened the letter.

---

> **Merchant's Guild Bank**
> **Office of the Guildmaster**
>
> Mr. Kaine,
>
> Your proposal is extremely interesting.
>
> The Merchant's Guild specializes in high-growth ventures. Your operational profile matches our investment thesis perfectly.
>
> **Preliminary Offer**:
> - Principal: 15,000 GP
> - Interest Rate: 3.8% APR (highly competitive)
> - No operational restrictions
> - No revenue-sharing requirements
> - Standard covenant: Maintain minimum 70% debt service coverage ratio
>
> We would very much like to schedule a meeting to discuss partnership opportunities.
>
> Available tomorrow, 10:00 AM.
>
> Guildmaster Voros Thane

---

Victor read it three times.

3.8% APR.

No revenue share.

No operational control.

Just a standard financial covenant (easily met).

It was objectively the best offer.

And the Merchant's Guild had responded in four hours—at 4:00 AM—which meant they were *very* interested.

Victor smiled.

He drafted three responses.

**To Malcom**:

> "Reviewing your revised terms. Will respond by noon."

**To Sterling**:

> "Reviewing all offers. Decision forthcoming."

**To Merchant's Guild**:

> "Meeting confirmed. 10:00 AM tomorrow. Looking forward to discussion."

He sent all three.

Valerius emerged from the corner where he'd been napping. "Did we... get a better offer?"

"Three-point-eight percent," Victor said. "No strings."

"That's... we're taking it, right?"

Victor leaned back. "Probably. But first, I want to see if Malcom panics."

Down in the jungle, the fifteen monitoring mosquitoes buzzed in agitation. They had transmitted everything—every letter, every number, every word.

And in his office at the Gilded Ledger, Director Malcom stared at a report from his surveillance team.

**Subject: Kaine, Victor**
**Status**: Negotiating with THREE institutions
**Competing Offers**: Merchant's Guild entered at 3.8% APR
**Assessment**: **CLIENT AT SEVERE RISK OF LOSS**

Malcom crushed the report in his fist.

He'd been outplayed.

Again.
