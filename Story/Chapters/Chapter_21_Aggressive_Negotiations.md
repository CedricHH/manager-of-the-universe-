# Chapter 21: Aggressive Negotiations

The silence stretched for exactly three seconds.

Victor counted. He always counted. Three seconds was the optimal window for confusion to settle before it crystallized into action. Any longer, and targets began thinking. Thinking led to questions. Questions required answers. Answers cost time.

Time was money. Money was survival.

"A human," Gareth repeated, lowering his sword by half an inch. "In a *suit*."

"Italian," Victor clarified. "Pre-owned. The original owner had... scheduling conflicts."

The tank blinked, processing the absurdity. Behind him, the rest of the Silver Lance shifted into defensive positions with the mechanical precision of experienced killers. Finn had a dagger in each hand, the blades catching torchlight. Bron's hammer was raised, tendons bulging in his forearms. Kaelie's staff crackled with arcane energy building toward critical mass. Lysa had already begun casting something—Victor caught the shimmer of a detection ward expanding outward. And Sister Alara's holy symbol pulsed with golden light, radiating warmth that made Victor's corrupted mana itch.

Six weapons. Zero cover. Eighteen feet of exposed corridor. One human in a torn Italian suit.

Victor's internal calculator ran the numbers with cold precision. Combat survival probability: 0%. Negotiation survival probability: 47%. Those were workable odds.

"I'm going to raise my hands now," Victor announced, doing exactly that. His fingers spread wide, showing empty palms. "This is not a threat display. This is basic customer service."

"Customer service?" Alara's voice was sharp, suspicious. Her detection skills were probably screaming at her across multiple threat categories. He was a monster. His mana signature was corrupted dungeon-born essence. Every instinct she had spent fifteen levels developing said 'kill on sight.'

But Victor was also talking. Talking in complete sentences. Using vocabulary that suggested education, intelligence, strategic thinking.

Talking monsters were anomalies.

Anomalies made adventurers hesitate.

Hesitation was opportunity.

"You're in a dungeon," Victor explained, his voice smooth and professional. Boardroom smooth. Quarterly earnings smooth. The voice that had once convinced shareholders to accept a thirty percent dividend reduction as a 'strategic opportunity.' "Dungeons provide services. Loot. Experience. Glory. These are products. You are customers. I am the customer service representative. Think of me as... your concierge."

Finn snorted, but his daggers didn't lower. "Dungeons don't have concierges."

"This one does. We also have complimentary floor hazards, a loyalty program for repeat visitors, and a very exclusive VIP experience on Floor Four." Victor tilted his head, studying them with undisguised analysis. "You've reached Floor Four. Congratulations. You qualify for the VIP package."

"You're a monster," Gareth growled, knuckles whitening around his sword hilt. "Monster in a suit is still a monster."

"I prefer 'alternative stakeholder.'" Victor lowered his hands slowly, deliberately, clasping them behind his back. Power pose. Confidence signaling. The body language of someone who had nothing to fear—which was, technically, a lie. But lies were just narratives requiring commitment. "But semantics aside, we have a mutual opportunity to discuss."

"We don't negotiate with dungeon spawn," Alara declared.

"Then you'll die."

The words landed like a hammer on glass.

Victor watched the micro-expressions flicker across their faces. Anger from Bron—raw, unfiltered, the simple fury of someone who solved problems through impact. Fear from Finn—the sharp, calculating fear of someone who understood mortality. Calculation from Gareth—the tank was already running threat assessments, weighing options, measuring distances. And from Alara... curiosity.

That was the opening. Curiosity was a crack in the wall. All Victor needed was a crack.

"The boss of this dungeon is a Level 20 Minotaur," Victor continued, his tone shifting to clinical analysis. Facts. Numbers. Data. The language of rationality. "Name: Asterion. Classification: Mythic Beast. Three centuries of continuous combat experience. Weapon: a Minotaur War-Axe of Ancestral design—enchanted, probably cursed, definitely unpleasant. Regeneration factor: significant. Pain tolerance: absolute."

He paused. Let the data accumulate in their minds.

"He has killed, by conservative estimate, four hundred and twelve adventurers. Parties ranging from Level 5 to Level 23. Average engagement duration: ninety-four seconds. Longest survival time: eleven minutes, thirty-two seconds. The party that achieved that record had two tanks, three healers, and a mage with a temporal manipulation skill." Victor's voice remained flat. Professional. "They still died. They just took longer doing it."

Silence.

"Your party composition is suboptimal for this engagement," Victor continued. "One tank—Gareth, Level 12, standard sword-and-board loadout. One off-tank—Bron, Level 14, berserker specialization, damage-focused. One DPS—Finn, Level 11, rogue. One healer—Sister Alara, Level 15, paladin subclass. One support—Lysa, Level 10, cleric. And one mage—Kaelie, Level 13."

"How do you know our levels?" Lysa demanded.

"You entered my dungeon. You triggered my detection wards. Your mana signatures are written on my spreadsheet." Victor tapped his temple. "I track all assets. It's what I do."

He let that sink in.

"Standard six-person configuration. The standard configuration survival rate against Asterion is—" He tilted his head, performing the calculation for dramatic effect. "—fourteen percent."

"Fourteen percent is not zero," Gareth said. His voice was steady, but Victor caught the slight elevation in pitch. Stress response.

"Fourteen percent assumes the boss fights fairly." Victor's mouth curved into something that might have been a smile. "Asterion does not fight fairly. He fights efficiently. There's a significant difference."

"So what?" Bron slammed his hammer against his palm, the impact echoing off stone walls. "We fight monster, monster dies. Simple. That's what we do."

"Simple," Victor agreed. "Also incorrect. But I appreciate the enthusiasm. It will make excellent viewing."

He took a step forward. Just one. Measured. Non-threatening. But pointedly closer.

"I'm offering you a choice. Not because I'm generous—I'm not—but because my employer has specific contractual requirements that must be fulfilled."

> **[ARMI]**
> Skill: [Aggressive Negotiations] - Active

> Tip: Present with confidence. Hesitation reduces efficacy by 34%.

"Option A," Victor said, raising one finger. "You fight me. Twenty-six goblins under my command. A maze of traps I personally designed. Acid pits. Sleep darts. That very amusing mud trap on Floor Three—you met Finn's dignity, I believe. You win—of course you win, you're overleveled for this floor—but you arrive at the boss room exhausted. Spell slots depleted. Potions consumed. Health at sixty percent. Most importantly, Alara will have burned through her cleansing abilities dealing with my poison array. Survival probability against Asterion drops to eight percent."

He raised a second finger.

"Option B. You walk past me. Right now. No fight. No traps. No resource expenditure. Fresh. Full resources. Full health. You fight the Minotaur at peak capacity. Survival probability remains at fourteen percent."

"Both options lead to the Minotaur," Lysa observed. The Cleric. Victor had almost forgotten about her—she hadn't moved since he started talking. No fidgeting. No shifting weight. Professional stillness. The stillness of someone who prayed for salvation but understood the value of observation. Dangerous in a way Victor wasn't measuring correctly.

"Correct," Victor confirmed. "The destination is fixed. The condition of arrival is variable. I'm giving you control over the variable."

"Why?" Alara demanded, stepping forward. Her holy symbol flared brighter, casting harsh shadows across Victor's face. "Why would a dungeon *want* us to fight its boss at full strength? What kind of trap is this?"

Ah. The real question. The question that separated adventurers from corpses.

Victor's smile widened.

"Because my employer doesn't want victims. He wants *opponents*." He gestured toward the stairway behind him, the darkness that led to Floor Four. "Asterion has been waiting three centuries for a worthy fight. Three hundred years of killing adventurers who weren't good enough, weren't strong enough, weren't *worthy*. He's tired. He's bored. He's beginning to wonder if death might be preferable to eternal tedium."

Victor paused. Let the weight of centuries settle in the air.

"You might be worthy. You probably aren't. But you're closer than the last forty-seven parties who tried. And that's enough for me to offer you this courtesy."

The Silver Lance exchanged glances. Victor could see the calculation happening in their eyes—the same calculation any rational agent would make when presented with asymmetric information and constrained choices. Trust the monster? Don't trust the monster? What did the monster gain? What did they lose?

Game theory in real time. Beautiful.

"If we walk past," Gareth said slowly, weighing each word, "you just... let us go?"

"I escort you to the arena. Complimentary service."

"And if we refuse both options? If we just... leave?"

Victor shrugged, a surprisingly human gesture for his frame.
 "Then we discover Option C together. I suspect it involves a lot of running and screaming. Primarily from me. I'm not built for combat. I'm built for negotiations. So. Shall we negotiate, or shall we see who can scream louder?"

The party huddled. Whispered arguments.

Victor waited. Patience was a resource. Time was an investment. He had plenty of both.

Finally, Gareth stepped forward. His jaw was set. Decision made.

"We walk. You escort. No tricks."

"No tricks," Victor agreed. "Tricks are inefficient."

He turned and began walking toward the stairs. Behind him, six sets of footsteps followed. The predators following the prey. Or perhaps—Victor allowed himself a moment of dark amusement—the prey following the bait.

The descent to Floor Four took four minutes.

Four minutes of silence. Four minutes of tension so thick Victor could taste it—the metallic tang of barely-restrained violence. Four minutes of the Silver Lance watching his back, ready to strike at the first sign of betrayal.

Victor didn't betray them. Betrayal was inefficient. He simply delivered them to the arena.

The chamber opened before them like the mouth of some ancient beast. A vast circular space, ringed with stone pillars older than human civilization. Torches flickered in iron sconces bolted to the walls, casting dancing shadows across the sand-covered floor. The sand was practical—it absorbed blood, provided footing, turned crimson into mere brown stains.

Easy cleanup. Victor appreciated the efficiency.

In the center stood Asterion.

The Minotaur was motionless, a statue of muscle and menace. His massive axe rested across his shoulders, the blade gleaming with dark enchantment. His eyes—ancient, heavy with centuries of solitude and slaughter—tracked the approaching party with something that might have been interest.

Or hunger.

Hard to tell with Minotaurs.

Victor stopped at the arena's edge, at the line where stone floor met combat sand.

"Asterion," he called out. "I've brought guests."

The Minotaur's gaze shifted to the Silver Lance. His nostrils flared, taking in their scent. Reading them in ways Victor's spreadsheets never could.

"Six," Asterion rumbled, his voice a tectonic event. "You promised worthy."

"I promised opponents," Victor corrected. "Worthiness is a subjective assessment that exceeds my contractual obligations. That determination is yours to make."

> **[ARMI]**
> Contract: [Tribute Fulfilled]
> Status: PENDING VERIFICATION
> Note: "Worthy opponents" clause subjective. Outcome required for final determination.
> Warning: Contract breach incurs penalty. Do not disappoint.

Asterion considered this. His massive head tilted, horns catching torchlight. For a long moment, he simply stared at the six adventurers who had come to kill him. Or die trying.

Then, slowly, he rose to his full height.

Eight feet of muscle, horn, and ancient fury. Three centuries of violence concentrated in a single form.

"COME," the Minotaur bellowed, his axe sweeping out in a challenge that shook dust from the ceiling. "SHOW ME IF YOU DESERVE TO DIE!"

Behind Victor, the Silver Lance drew their weapons.

Victor stepped aside, finding a pillar with an excellent view.

The negotiation was over.

Now came the performance review.

And Victor had a feeling this one would require some creative accounting.
