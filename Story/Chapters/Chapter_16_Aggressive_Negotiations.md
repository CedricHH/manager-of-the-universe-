# Chapter 16: Aggressive Negotiations

Victor Kaine stared up at eight hundred pounds of prehistoric muscle and wondered if his life insurance policy would cover "liquidation by minotaur."

Asterion did not look like he was in the mood for a PowerPoint presentation. His nostrils flared, venting puffs of hot, humid steam that smelled of old stone and raw iron. The Minotaur’s hand was wrapped around the hilt of a double-headed axe that looked like it had been carved from a meteor. 

"The clock strikes, little Manager," Asterion rumbled. The sound didn't just vibrate in the air; it vibrated in Victor's marrow. "The 'business plan' better be edible. Because I am currently considering a raw meat diet."

Victor adjusted his tattered collar. His heart was hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird, but his face remained a mask of professional boredom. He had faced down billionaire board members who wanted to erase his existence for a 2% dividend increase. This was just a larger, hairier version of the same transaction.

"First," Victor said, his voice ringing with a crisp, analytical clarity that even he didn't quite feel. "We need to address your current performance metrics. I’ve initialized a review."

Asterion’s brow—massive and ridged with bone—furrowed in genuine confusion. "Per-for-mance? Metrics? You speak in riddles, human."

"I speak in math," Victor countered. He tapped his vision edge, activating a skill he hadn’t used in this capacity before.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Skill Activated**: [Performance Review]
> **Target**: Asterion (Boss-Class)
> **Level**: 20
> **Tenure**: 247 Years
> **Status**: Distressed Stakeholder / Critical Ennui

Victor felt the rush of data. It flooded his mind—stats, history, psychological pressure points. It was like reading a spreadsheet that breathed.

"Two hundred and forty-seven years," Victor said, pacing a three-foot line in front of the beast. "That’s how long you’ve been standing in that basement on Floor Four. Correct?"

Asterion paused, his grip on the axe loosening by a microscopic margin. "I have guarded the Core since the First Awakening. That is my purpose."

"Guarded it from what? A few stray slimes? The occasional party of farmhands with rusty pitchforks?" Victor gestured toward the stairs where the Silver Lance had just vanished. "In two hundred and forty-seven years, how many times have you been promoted?"

"Promoted?" Asterion repeated. The word sounded foreign in his mouth.

"Befördert," Victor translated, using the archaic term. "Moved to a higher position. Given more territory. Given better equipment."

"I am the Boss of Floor Four," Asterion said, his voice gaining a defensive edge. "There is no higher."

"Wrong," Victor snapped. "There is the whole world. There is Regional Management. There is Chief Security Officer. But instead, you’ve spent two and a half centuries in a windowless room, killing 1,847 people. Do you even remember their names?"

Asterion’s red eyes narrowed. "I remember their blood. Their screams. It is... enough."

"Is it?" Victor stopped pacing and looked the Minotaur directly in the eye. "Because my analysis says you’re bored. You didn't come up here for gold, Asterion. You came up here because you wanted something to happen. Anything. You wanted to see if the Manager would finally do something different."

Victor took a step closer, well within the reach of that massive axe. 

"You aren't a Boss," Victor whispered. "You're a tenant. And you’re being underpaid for your lease."

***

Asterion’s head tilted. The massive horns, sharp enough to core a castle wall, swept through the air. "Underpaid... lease? You use words that taste like dry parchment, human. But I follow the scent. You say the Core has failed me."

"The Core hasn't failed you," Victor corrected, a sliver of ice in his tone. "The Core is a set of hardcoded protocols. It does what it was designed to do: generate threats and manage assets. It’s an operating system, Asterion. And you’ve been running a Legacy Build for two centuries."

Victor stepped around a jagged piece of masonry, his eyes never leaving the Minotaur’s. 

"The dungeon world is changing. The 'Hero and Boss' model is undergoing a massive market correction. Parties are getting more professional. They have better gear, better intel, better healers. Eventually, a group will come that you can't just 'roar' away. And when they kill you, you'll respawn, and the Cycle will repeat. Forever. No growth. No dividends. Just a 1:1 ratio of misery."

Asterion snorted, a wet, heavy sound. "And you? You are but a Level One fluke. A 'Manager' with no mana and a tongue of silver. Why should I listen to a fruit that hasn't even ripened?"

"Because," Victor said, and for the first time, he let a small, predatory smile touch his lips. "I’m the only one here who knows how to scale this operation. You kill me now, you get a snack. You keep me alive, you get a career."

Victor gestured to the surrounding shadows, where a dozen pairs of goblin eyes hovered in the gloom.

"I’m restructuring this dungeon. We are moving from a 'Survival-Based Model' to a 'Revenue-Based Experience.' We aren't just here to kill adventurers; we are here to harvest them. And a harvest needs security. It needs a General. Someone who understands tactical deployment. Someone who isn't just a monster behind a door, but a leader of a multi-floor defense network."

Asterion stared at him. The silence stretched, thick with the smell of damp earth and the heavy thrum of the Dungeon Core somewhere below. 

**"Chief... Security... Officer,"** the Minotaur rumbled, testing the words. They sounded ridiculous coming from him, yet they held a weight of authority that 'Floor Boss' never had.

"Precisely," Victor said. "CSO. You would be responsible for the security of the entire regional corridor. Training the next generation of entities. Coordinating the 'performances.' In exchange, you get more than just tribute. You get equity."

"Equity," Asterion breathed. "More riddles."

"A share of the profit," Victor simplified. "Gold. Recognition. And most importantly... structure. A reason to stand in this room that isn't just because a Core told you to."

Victor reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, glowing shard—a bit of pyritized mana he’d salvaged earlier. He held it out on his flat palm.

"This is a down payment. A signing bonus. Take it, and we begin the onboarding process. Refuse, and you can go back to waiting another two hundred years for someone to ask your name."

Asterion’s giant hand hovered over the tiny shard. His claws were the size of daggers, his skin like weathered leather. 

Slowly, his fingers closed around the mana shard. He didn't crush it. He just held it.

**"The small green one calls you 'Boss',"** Asterion said, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous hum. **"He is foolish. But he is well-fed. If this... 'onboarding'... fails to satisfy, Manager, I will find a very professional use for your skull."**

"I’d expect nothing less from my new CSO," Victor said, his pulse finally beginning to settle. "Now, let's talk about your benefits package. We’ll start with the grievance policy."

***

Victor tapped the air, calling up the ARMI interface. The golden-black grid flickered into life, a Bloomberg-esque terminal reflected in his tired pupils. 

"ARMI," he whispered. "Draft a standard [Guardian’s Pact]. CSO designation. Tier 1 security clearance. Clause 47-B for non-lethal engagement incentives. Signing bonus: 10 GP equivalent in processed mana."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Generating Contract**: [The Guardian's Pact]
> **Parties**: Victor Kaine (Manager) & Asterion (Boss-Class)
> **Role**: Chief Security Officer (CSO)
> **Cost**: 10 GP (Deducted from Operations Budget)
> **Status**: PENDING SIGNATURE

A scroll of translucent light manifested between them. It wasn't paper; it was a complex web of legal-geometric symbols that hummed with binding magic.

"Your thumb," Victor said, pointing to the blank space at the bottom of the glowing document. "It won't hurt. It just... synchronizes your intent with the dungeon's core logic."

Asterion didn't hesitate. He pressed his massive, calloused thumb against the light. 

> **[ARMI]**
> **Signature Verified**.
> **CONTRACT SIGNED**: [Succession Protocol 1.1 Initialized]
> **New Employee Registered**: [Asterion - CSO]
> **Balance**: 40 GP → 30 GP
> **Note**: Infrastructure stability increased by 47%. Risk of workplace violence reduced by 82%. 

"Welcome to the team, General," Victor said, feeling a weight lift from his shoulders that he hadn't realized was there. "Sniv, bring him a clipboard. A large one. And find something that looks like an ID badge. We have standards to maintain."

Sniv, who had been watching from the rafters with a mixture of awe and sheer terror, practically tumbled down. "Yes, Boss! Big clipboard! Shiny badge! Sniv gets special badge too?"

"In time, Sniv. In time."

Asterion looked at his hands, then at the glowing sword still embedded in the stone of Floor Three. He looked... different. Still a monster, still a titan of muscle and horn, but the existential haze that had clouded his eyes for two centuries had cleared. He had a task. He had a title. 

**"And the flesh... I mean, the 'clients'?"** Asterion asked, his voice losing its predatory edge and gaining a professional curiosity. **"When do they return?"**

"Sooner than you think," Victor said, checking his perimeter notifications. "Now that the Silver Lance has fled, the rumor of a 'Hidden Boss' will be circulating through Oakhaven by sunset. The 'Glow-stick Sword' wasn't enough, but a Minotaur roar? That’s a Tier 4 marketing campaign."

Suddenly, the ARMI ticker at the edge of his vision began to scroll rapidly in Alert Red.

> **[ARMI]**
> **New Perimeter Alert**.
> **Entity Detected**: [The Iron Wolves]
> **Classification**: Veteran Party (Silver-Rank)
> **Threat Assessment**: CRITICAL (Level 18-22)
> **Status**: Entering Ruins.

Victor’s heart skipped a beat. This wasn't the slow, steady build-up he’d hoped for. This was market acceleration. The Iron Wolves—one of Oakhaven’s heavy hitters—had ignored the rumors and come to verify the 'Boss' themselves.

"They're here already," Victor whispered, a grin spreading across his face despite the sudden spike in danger. He looked up at Asterion. "CSO, take your position on Floor Four. Actually, no. Let’s change the choreography. I want them to reach Floor Three before they hear the first roar. I want them to feel the 'High-Stakes' environment."

Asterion nodded, his horns catching the dim dungeon light. **"I will prepare the 'Client Evaluation,' Manager."**

"Good," Victor said, stepping back into the shadows. "Let’s show them why this startup is worth the investment."
