# Chapter 104: The Harvest

Dawn. Floor 2. The Fungal Caverns.

The Automated Slime Farm Alpha sprawled across what had been moss-covered stone two days ago. Twenty breeding pools, each the size of a wagon, carved into the cavern floor. Mana-fed channels connected them in a lattice pattern. Automated extractors—crystalline mechanisms Victor had purchased from the Merchant Guild—hung above each pool like mechanical spiders.

Victor stood at the observation platform, watching the first harvest.

The slimes pulsed in their pools. Gelatinous masses, color-coded by type: green for health, blue for mana, yellow for stamina. The extractors descended with surgical precision, piercing the slimes' outer membranes, pulling cores without killing the creatures.

Humane. Efficient. Repeatable.

The cores traveled along conveyor mechanisms to a central processing station where automated sorters divided them by quality.

>   
> **Status**: FIRST HARVEST SUCCESSFUL

Victor picked up a health core from the sorting bin. Green. Translucent. Pulsing with condensed mana.

Perfect quality. Better than dungeon drops—those varied wildly depending on slime age and stress levels. These were cultivated under controlled conditions. Standardized.

The Guild couldn't match this.

Footsteps on the stone behind him.

Marcus Thiel approached, alchemist's toolkit slung over his shoulder, eyes wide.

"This is incredible," Marcus said, voice hushed. "The Guild would kill for a supply chain this clean."

"They're going to try," Victor replied. He set the core back in the bin. "Which is why we're not waiting two weeks."

Marcus blinked. "Sir?"

"Kira was right. Lysander will notice your absence in three days. We're not giving him time to prepare defenses." Victor turned to face the alchemist. "We open tomorrow."

"Tomorrow?" Marcus's voice cracked. "The shop isn't finished! We don't have—"

"The shop is ninety percent complete. That's enough. We launch with what we have."

"But—"

"Marcus." Victor's tone didn't rise. Didn't need to. "Lysander is reactive or proactive. If we wait, he fortifies his position. If we strike first, he scrambles to respond. Scrambling enemies make mistakes. We open at dawn."

Marcus swallowed. Nodded. "What do you need from me?"

"Two thousand potions by sunrise. Can you do it?"

The alchemist looked at the cores. At the processing station. At the sheer volume of perfect-quality inputs.

"Yes," he said. "I can do it."

"Good. Let's go."

---

The Strategy Room felt cramped with all four of them present.

Victor sat at the head of the table. Sniv to his left, vibrating with barely contained excitement. Asterion to his right, stoic as always. Marcus across from him, taking notes.

"Original timeline," Victor began, "was two weeks of silent production, then launch. New timeline: we open tomorrow at dawn."

Asterion's expression didn't change, but his tone sharpened. "Why accelerate?"

"Lysander discovers Marcus's defection in three days. If we launch before that, we control the narrative. He's reactive instead of proactive."

"And if he retaliates violently?"

"You have twelve guards and forty-two professional soldiers on retainer. Can you hold a fortified position against Guild enforcers?"

"Yes."

"Then we proceed."

Sniv raised his hand so fast he nearly fell out of his chair. "Boss! Boss! Goblins are ready! Customer service training complete! Synergy levels are MAXIMUM!"

Victor almost smiled. "Good. Marcus, concerns?"

The alchemist hesitated. "We only have one day's inventory. Two thousand potions. What if we sell out in hours?"

"We will sell out. That's the strategy."

Marcus frowned. "I don't understand."

"Scarcity creates perceived value," Victor explained. "The Guild keeps inventory in stock and charges fifty silver. We sell out immediately at ten silver. Which product looks more valuable to consumers?"

Understanding dawned on Marcus's face. "Artificial scarcity as marketing."

"Exactly. Day two onwards, we maintain steady supply. But day one? We make noise. We force every adventurer in Oakhaven to talk about the apothecary that sold out in hours."

Victor pulled up an ARMI projection—timeline flowchart, hovering between them.

> **[ARMI - REVISED TIMELINE]**
> **Launch**: TOMORROW, dawn  
> **Day 1 Inventory**: 2,000 potions  
> **Projected Sellout Time**: 4-6 hours  
> **Lysander Response Window**: 8-12 hours post-launch  
>   
> **Phase 2** (Day 2+):  
> Continuous production: 2,000 cores/week = ~285 potions/day  
> Sustainable revenue: ~28 GP/day, ~196 GP/week  
>   
> **Risk Assessment**:  
> - Premature launch risk: 34% (acceptable)  
> - Guild violent retaliation: 68% (security mitigated)  
> - Market rejection: 12% (low - price advantage dominant)  
>   
> **Recommendation**: PROCEED

"Assignments," Victor said. "Marcus: begin production immediately. Target is two thousand potions by dawn. Sniv: deploy goblin shopkeepers to the apothecary tonight. Asterion: final security sweep and prepare contingencies for Guild retaliation."

"And you, Boss?" Sniv asked.

"I'm drafting a message to Lysander. Controlled first contact."

Silence.

"You're going to *tell* him you're opening?" Marcus said slowly.

"I'm going to invite professional competition. It establishes legal precedent and forces him to respond within market regulations instead of hiring thugs."

"And if he hires thugs anyway?"

Victor glanced at Asterion. The minotaur's expression was answer enough.

"We launch at dawn," Victor repeated. "No delays. Dismissed."

**Marcus's Alchemy Lab - Floor 3, Dungeon Insolvia**

Midnight.

Marcus had never worked with inputs this good.

Twelve years in the Guild, he'd processed thousands of cores. Dungeon drops. Monster harvests. Black market acquisitions. All inconsistent. All requiring quality adjustments.

These cores? Perfect. Every. Single. One.

He fell into the rhythm:

1. Core extraction (mana pulled via controlled dissolution)
2. Reagent mixing (Guild-standard formula, nothing proprietary)
3. Stabilization (mana binding to alchemical base)
4. Bottling (crystal vials, cork stoppers, wax seal)

Production line. Assembly process. Exactly the kind of efficiency the Guild could never achieve because Lysander insisted on artisan methods.

Artisan methods that justified fifty-silver prices.

Victor wasn't trying to justify anything. He was trying to dominate through volume.

By 4 AM, Marcus had produced 2,000 potions.

He stared at the racks of vials, glowing faintly in the dim mana-light.

"Victor's not just disrupting the market," he murmured to himself. "He's going to replace it entirely."

---

**Insolvia Apothecary - Market Quarter, Night**

Sniv supervised final preparations with the intensity of a general deploying troops.

Ten goblin shopkeepers stood in formation, wearing tiny aprons embroidered with "INSOLVIA APOTHECARY" in crooked stitching.

"Listen! Listen!" Sniv barked. "Tomorrow is VERY IMPORTANT DAY! Customers will come! You will greet them! You will sell potions! You will NOT eat customers!"

One goblin raised a hand. "What if customer is very rude?"

"Still no eating!"

"What if customer smells delicious?"

"ESPECIALLY no eating if delicious!"

The goblin looked disappointed but nodded.

Asterion watched from the doorway, arms crossed. "Your training methods are... unconventional."

"Sniv's methods are VERY effective!" The goblin puffed his chest. "Zero casualties during training! This is RECORD!"

"That's not reassuring."

"Asterion worries too much! Goblins are professionals now!"

One of the goblins practiced his greeting: "WELCOME TO BOSS'S HEALING JUICE EMPORIUM!"

"Is '*Apothecary*,'" Sniv corrected. "Not emporium. Try again!"

"APOTH... APOCK... HEALING PLACE!"

Sniv sighed. "Close enough."

Three of Asterion's guards patrolled the perimeter. The apothecary itself was a corner building—stone walls, reinforced door, iron shutters on the windows. The main floor had a sales counter, display shelves, and a back room for inventory storage.

Simple. Professional. Defensible.

"Security assessment?" Sniv asked Asterion.

"Adequate. Three guards on perimeter, panic room accessible from back storage, escape tunnel to dungeon entrance. If the Guild attacks, we can hold or evacuate."

"Good! Good! Sniv will report success to Boss!"

The goblin activated his communication crystal. "Boss! Shop is ready! Goblins are VERY professional! Defenses are excellent!"

Victor's voice crackled back: "Good. See you at dawn."

---

**Core Chamber - 2 AM**

Victor drafted the letter.

Not encrypted. Public record. Deliberate.

He wrote:

> **To: Guild Master Lysander, Merchant Guild of Oakhaven**  
> **From: Victor Kaine, Proprietor of Insolvia Apothecary**  
>   
> **Subject: Market Competition Notice**  
>   
> Guild Master Lysander,  
>   
> Effective dawn today, Insolvia Apothecary will offer health, mana, and stamina potions at competitive market rates.  
>   
> **Our pricing**:  
> - Health Potion: 10 silver  
> - Mana Potion: 15 silver  
> - Stamina Potion: 12 silver  
>   
> Quality guaranteed to match or exceed Guild standards.  
>   
> This is not a hostile action. This is market competition.  
>   
> I look forward to your professional response.  
>   
> Respectfully,  
> **Victor Kaine**

He read it twice. Removed nothing. Added nothing.

Perfect.

The letter would arrive at Guild headquarters at dawn—same time the apothecary opened. Lysander would read it while Victor's shop was already selling potions.

Controlled timing. Maximum psychological impact.

Victor sealed the letter and summoned a courier. "Deliver this to the Merchant Guild tower at first light."

The courier—a young runner from the Merchant Guild's messaging service—nodded and left.

Victor leaned back in his chair.

Lysander would interpret the letter as an insult. Good. Angry opponents made tactical errors.

He'd either ignore Victor (unlikely—market share loss would be immediate) or retaliate quickly (likely—pride and forty-two years of monopoly don't yield easily).

Either way, Victor controlled the timing.

One final check: Victor walked to the chamber's edge and reviewed the security protocols with Asterion via communication crystal.

"Perimeter secure?"

"Yes."

"Guards briefed on Rules of Engagement?"

"Non-lethal unless escalated. Documented on recording crystals."

"Escape routes clear?"

"Tested. Functional."

"Good. Get some rest. Tomorrow we change Oakhaven's economy."

"Understood."

Victor closed the connection.

The BROKEN CROWN data crystal still glowed faintly on his desk. Two weeks to decide.

He ignored it.

One crisis at a time.

---

**Merchant Guild Tower - Dawn**

Guild Master Lysander appreciated routine.

Forty-two years running the Merchant Guild. Forty-two years of controlled markets, fixed prices, and compliant competitors.

The letter arrived with his morning tea.

He broke the seal. Read.

Read again.

Read a third time.

**Ten silver.**

This... *amateur*... was selling health potions for ten silver.

Lysander's production cost was eight silver per potion. His price: fifty silver. Profit margin: 525%.

If he matched Victor's price, he'd operate at 25% margin. Barely sustainable.

If he didn't match, he'd lose customers to an eighty-percent discount.

This wasn't competition.

This was economic warfare.

Lysander crushed the letter in his fist.

He activated his communication crystal. "Assemble the Council. Immediately."

Within the hour, the Guild's inner circle gathered in the strategy room:

- **Master Alchemist Theren** (production lead, age 50, cautious)
- **Enforcer Kale** (security, age 35, pragmatic)
- **Treasurer Valis** (accountant, age 60, risk-averse)

Lysander tossed the crumpled letter onto the table.

"A dungeon merchant is selling potions at ten silver. Our market share is under direct attack."

Theren picked up the letter, smoothed it, read. "Impossible. At ten silver, he's operating near cost. He'll bankrupt himself in a week."

"Unless," Treasurer Valis interjected, "his production costs are lower than ours."

Lysander's jaw tightened. "Marcus."

Marcus Thiel. Journeyman alchemist. Didn't report for his shift three days ago.

"Find him," Lysander said to Kale. "If he's working for this 'Victor Kaine,' I want to know how their operation functions."

"And if he refuses to come?"

"Then make an example. But gather intelligence first. I need to know what we're dealing with."

Kale nodded and left.

Lysander turned to the window, looking out over the Market Quarter.

Somewhere down there, a dungeon merchant thought he could challenge forty-two years of institutional power.

We'll see how long that confidence lasts.

**Insolvia Apothecary - Dawn**

Victor stood outside the shop as the sun crested the horizon.

The line already stretched down the block.

Word had spread overnight: health potions for ten silver. Eighty percent cheaper than the Guild.

Adventurers. Merchants. Common laborers who couldn't normally afford Guild prices. All waiting.

Sniv bounced on his heels. "Boss! Boss! SO MANY CUSTOMERS! This is VERY good for quarterly revenue projections!"

Asterion surveyed the crowd with professional suspicion. "This is a crowd control nightmare. If they rush the door—"

"They won't," Victor said. "Sniv, open the doors. Four customers at a time. Keep the line orderly."

"YES, BOSS!"

The doors opened.

The first four customers entered.

**Inside**:

Goblin greeter (wearing crooked apron, holding clipboard): "WELCOME TO INSOLVIA APOTHECARY! WE HAVE HEALING JUICE VERY CHEAP!"

Customer (Level 5 adventurer, suspicious): "...You mean health potions?"

"YES! ALSO MANA JUICE AND STAMINA JUICE!"

"I'll take two health potions."

The goblin at the counter carefully counted out the vials. "Twenty silver, please!"

The adventurer paid. Examined the potions. Tested one immediately.

The potion worked. Perfectly. His minor wound from yesterday's dungeon run closed instantly.

Guild quality. One-fifth the price.

He bought four more.

Word spread down the line.

---

**Two hours later**: 800 potions sold. Revenue: 8,000 silver (80 GP).

**Four hours later**: 1,600 potions sold. Revenue: 16,000 silver (160 GP).

**Hour five**: Shelves nearly empty. Security incident.

Enforcer Kale arrived.

Six Guild enforcers. Levels 12-15. Armed with staves and alchemical grenades (non-lethal, but intimidating).

They didn't attack.

They just... settled in across the street. Watching. Taking notes.

Asterion moved to intercept, but Victor held up a hand.

"Let them observe."

"They're gathering intelligence."

"I know. The more they see, the more they realize I'm not running a black-market operation. This is legitimate competition."

Kale's gaze met Victor's across the crowded street.

Professional assessment. No hostility. Just data collection.

After thirty minutes, Kale gestured to his team. They left.

**Asterion**: "They'll report to Lysander."

"Good. Let him know exactly what he's up against."

---

**Noon**: The last potion sold.

The line still stretched down the block, but the inventory was gone.

Sniv posted a sign on the door: "**SOLD OUT. Restocking Tomorrow. Same Prices.**"

The crowd groaned but dispersed.

Inside, the goblin shopkeepers high-fived each other (a gesture Sniv had taught them, though they didn't understand its origin).

Victor reviewed the day's results via ARMI:

> **[ARMI - DAY 1 PERFORMANCE]**
> **Sales**: 2,000 potions (100% inventory)  
> **Revenue**: 20,000 silver (200 GP)  
> **Time to Sellout**: 5 hours, 23 minutes  
> **Customer Count**: 847 unique buyers  
> **Average Purchase**: 2.4 potions/customer  
>   
> **Market Impact**:  
> Estimated Guild revenue loss: 80,000 silver (800 GP) [customers who would have paid Guild prices]  
> Market penetration: 18% (Day 1)  
>   
> **Detected Threats**:  
> - Guild Enforcer surveillance: CONFIRMED  
> - Intelligence gathering operation: ACTIVE  
> - Estimated retaliation timeline: 24-48 hours  
>   
> **Recommendation**: Prepare legal defenses. Monitor Guild response. Continue production.

Victor closed the shop and returned to the dungeon.

Phase One complete: market disruption successful.

Phase Two begins tomorrow: survive Lysander's counter-attack.

---

That evening, Victor sat in his office, reviewing contingency plans.

The BROKEN CROWN data crystal still glowed on his desk.

Two weeks to decide.

But right now, he had a Guild War to win.

One crisis at a time.

That's how you build empires.
