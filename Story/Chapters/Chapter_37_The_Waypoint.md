# Chapter 37: The Waypoint

Oakhaven announced itself through competent urban planning.

Victor crossed the city threshold and immediately catalogued the differences from Sterling's extractive infrastructure. Paved roads—not packed dirt with occasional cobblestones, but actual maintained thoroughfares with drainage channels and regular repair evidence. Street lighting via enchanted crystals at intersections. Functioning sewage systems judging by the absence of the open-pit stench that plagued medieval Earth cities.

Someone had invested in infrastructure optimization.

> **[ARMI - CITY ASSESSMENT: OAKHAVEN]**
> Population: 32,000+ (estimated)
> Economic Classification: Regional Trade Hub
> Infrastructure Quality: 73% (Above Average)
> Market Activity: High (multiple guild halls detected)
> Assessment: Viable commercial ecosystem
> Opportunity Rating: EXCELLENT

The merchant quarter sprawled across the city's eastern district—guild halls flying various professional banners, market stalls displaying goods that suggested diverse supply chains, and the kind of calculated commercial chaos Victor associated with functioning capitalism.

Zip poked his snout from the bag. "Big city! Many buildings! Much commerce!"

"Many opportunities," Victor corrected. "And many competitors. Back in the bag."

"Zip going!" The kobold vanished with only minor grumbling.

Victor needed information before making commercial moves. Specifically: the Consortium waypoint's location.

He stopped at a merchant quarter inn—the kind of establishment that catered to traveling traders and therefore employed staff who knew every commercial location in the city.

The innkeeper, a woman with the efficient demeanor of someone who'd managed hospitality operations for decades, barely looked up from her ledger.

"Room's two Silver per night. Three meals included. Stable boarding extra."

"Information first," Victor said, sliding a Silver Piece across the counter. "I'm looking for the old Consortium office."

The innkeeper's eyes flicked to the coin, then to Victor with slightly more interest.

"The Consortium building? Temple Street, near the old church district. Nobody's used it in..." She paused, calculating. "Century? Maybe more. Consortium pulled out of Oakhaven when the kingdom consolidated trade regulations. Building's just been sitting there gathering dust."

"Accessible?"

"I mean, the door's probably locked, but nobody maintains it. Why? You some kind of historian?"

"Merchant with institutional connections," Victor said smoothly. "Checking on legacy assets."

The innkeeper pocketed the coin with professional efficiency. "Temple Street. Three blocks north, two west. Big stone building with faded symbols over the entrance. Can't miss it."

Victor nodded thanks and left.

Behind him, the innkeeper made a mental note: *Merchant asking about dead Consortium office. Probably nothing. But odd.*

---

Temple Street felt abandoned compared to the merchant quarter's commercial vitality.

The old church district—displaced generations ago when Oakhaven's religious center relocated to accommodate population growth—consisted of repurposed buildings, quiet residential conversions, and the occasional structure left empty because no one quite knew what to do with ecclesiastical architecture.

The Consortium building stood out.

Three stories, stone construction suggesting institutional permanence, and faded glyphs above the entrance that matched the symbols on Victor's black card. Heavy dust on the windows. No recent foot traffic visible in the street grime.

But when Victor approached, the door's locking mechanism clicked.

Automated recognition. The black card in his pocket responding to proximity sensors that had waited centuries for authorized access.

Victor pushed the door open.

---

The interior smelled of preserved time.

No rot. No decay. Just dust and the faint ozone scent of dormant magical infrastructure maintaining atmospheric stasis.

The reception hall stretched thirty feet to a central pedestal—raised platform, crystalline surface, clearly designed as an interface terminal. Consortium efficiency: no ornamentation, no wasted space, pure function.

Victor's ARMI interface flickered with warnings.

> **[ARMI - ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN]**
> Magical Infrastructure: ACTIVE (standby mode)
> Monitoring Systems: DETECTED
> Warning: Card activation will transmit status data
> External Recipients: Consortium Administrative Network
> Privacy Level: NONE
> Recommendation: Proceed with awareness of surveillance

Victor had expected this.

The Consortium didn't give authority upgrades without collecting data. This was the price of advancement—letting them know exactly where he was, what he'd accomplished, and that he was following their plan.

Or appearing to follow it.

He walked to the pedestal and placed the black card on the crystalline surface.

Light erupted.

---

The activation sequence was pure Consortium aesthetic—no dramatic flair, no theatrical holography, just efficient data transfer with visual confirmation protocols.

Glyphs materialized in the air above the pedestal, scrolling through authentication processes Victor's upgraded ARMI automatically translated.

> **CONSORTIUM MESSAGE**:

Victor absorbed the information with cold calculation.

Ninety days until direct oversight. Three months to build enough infrastructure and leverage that he could survive Consortium scrutiny while actively undermining their harvest protocols.

Tight timeline. Manageable.

The holographic display shifted, presenting Victor's upgraded capabilities.

**New ARMI Functions**:
- Extended range environmental scanning (500-meter radius vs. previous 50-meter baseline)
- Detailed financial projection modeling (quarterly forecasts, market trend analysis)
- Contract binding authority increased (can enforce agreements on targets up to Level 15)
- Real-time dungeon monitoring (remote connection to Nova's core systems)

**New Skill Unlocked**:
- **[Asset Liquidation]**: Convert immobilized target directly into Gold Pieces (bypass loot drops, instant capital extraction)

And most importantly:

**Encrypted Archive Access** (2 of 3 files):

File 1: *Restructurer Operations Manual*  
File 2: *Terra-Insolvia Economic History*  
File 3: **[LOCKED - Requires Authorization Level 5]**

Victor pulled up File 1 immediately.

The manual was exactly what he'd expected—standard Consortium protocols for world restructuring. Population management guidelines, harvest preparation timelines, resource extraction optimization, and the clinical documentation of how to prepare a civilization for systematic exploitation.

Reading it felt like reviewing his old corporate playbooks. Except instead of "workforce reduction," the terminology was "population adjustment." Instead of "asset liquidation," it said "resource reclamation."

Same methods. Different scale. Identical ruthlessness.

Victor had written reports like this on Earth. The parallel was uncomfortable and useful.

File 2 provided context: Terra-Insolvia's economic development over two millennia. The Consortium's initial investment, Restructurer #1's rebellion, the subsequent abandonment, and the gradual economic recovery that had occurred without cosmic oversight.

Interesting data point: Terra-Insolvia's economy had *improved* during the fifteen centuries without Consortium management.

Victor filed that away for future leverage.

The display faded. The black card cooled. The upgrade sequence complete.

Victor pocketed the card and turned toward the exit.

He'd gained power. Paid for it with surveillance. And now someone in the Consortium's administrative network knew exactly where he was and how well he was performing.

The game continued.

---

Victor stepped into Temple Street's late afternoon shadows.

And immediately knew he wasn't alone.

Not obvious surveillance. Not threatening positioning. But professional observation executed with the discipline of someone trained in intelligence gathering.

Victor's upgraded ARMI identified the source.

> **[ARMI - THREAT ASSESSMENT]**
> Target Detected: Humanoid, 47 meters, rooftop position (2 o'clock) [Enhanced Optics Active]
> Level: 15-18 (estimated, stealth-focused build)
> Equipment: Observer class (no visible weapons, lightweight armor)
> Affiliation: UNKNOWN
> Behavior Pattern: Passive monitoring, documentation probable
> Threat Level: LOW (information gathering, not hostile engagement)
> Recommendation: Acknowledge awareness but do not engage

Victor didn't look directly at the watcher. Didn't react. Walked calmly toward the merchant quarter with the easy confidence of someone conducting legitimate business.

The watcher didn't follow. Didn't attempt contact. Simply... observed.

From the travel bag, Zip's whisper: "Zip detect... someone watching?"

"Yes," Victor confirmed quietly.

"Bad watching or curious watching?"

"Information gathering. Someone wants to know who I am before making contact."

"What Zip do?"

"Stay quiet. Stay ready. Remember—we're merchants. Just merchants with very good institutional connections."

Victor maintained casual pace toward the inn the innkeeper had mentioned—a mid-tier establishment called *The Silver Standard* that catered to traveling merchants with enough capital for comfort but not enough for luxury.

Perfect cover.

Behind him, the Consortium waypoint building's automated systems returned to standby mode, waiting for the next authorized activation that might not come for another century.

And somewhere in Oakhaven's information networks, a report was being written.

**Subject**: Unknown merchant activated dormant Consortium waypoint  
**Observation**: Professional demeanor, institutional authorization, significant ARMI signature  
**Recommendation**: Monitor, assess affiliation, determine threat/opportunity classification  

Victor checked into The Silver Standard, secured a room, and released Zip to stretch in private.

The kobold immediately scrambled to the window. "Boss! Oakhaven very big! Many opportunities! Much—"

"Synergies, yes." Victor sat on the room's single chair, mentally reviewing the day's developments.

Partnership with Sterling: Established.  
Legitimate permits: Acquired.  
Consortium upgrade: Complete.  
Surveillance: Active.

Ninety days until quarterly audit.

Time to see what Oakhaven's markets actually looked like. Time to convert Silver Sterling's endorsement into commercial leverage. Time to build the infrastructure that would let him survive Consortium oversight while systematically undermining everything they represented.

Victor pulled out his newly upgraded ARMI interface and began mapping Oakhaven's economic landscape.

Somewhere in the city, someone was mapping him.

The game had entered a new phase.

And Victor intended to win it.
