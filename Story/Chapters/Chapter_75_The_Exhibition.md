# Chapter 75: The Exhibition

8:00 AM.

Ninety-two spectators filed into the viewing room.

They found their seats.

Looked at the registration board.

**EMPTY.**

Confusion rippled through the crowd.

"Where are the parties?"

"We paid in advance!"

"Is this a scam?"

The projection screens flickered.

Victor's face appeared—calm, professional.

"Ladies and gentlemen. Due to circumstances beyond our control, all registered parties have withdrawn from today's tournament."

The crowd erupted.

"REFUND!"

"This is theft!"

Victor waited for silence.

"However. The show will go on."

Skeptical murmurs.

"Today, you will witness something unprecedented in Oakhaven's history."

He paused.

"**The dungeon's own employees will challenge Ignatia.**"

Silence.

Then: "...What?"

***

**The Roster**

Victor's projection split into three panels.

"Three teams. Three matches. Three chances to prove the Ember Trials are more than external adventurers."

**Panel 1 - Team Management**:
- Asterion (Tank - Minotaur, Level 22)
- Valerius (Support - Vampire, Level 19)
- Zip (Healer - Kobold, Level 14)

**Panel 2 - Team Operations**:
- Gorg (DPS - Troll, Level 18)
- Sniv (Rogue - Goblin, Level 16)
- Roland (Paladin - Level 20)

**Panel 3 - Solo Exhibition**:
- Victor Kaine (Asset Manager - Level 2)

The crowd stared.

Someone shouted: "That's rigged! Employees will throw the fight!"

Victor's expression didn't change.

"If you believe that, you're welcome to leave. Full refunds at the exit."

Nobody moved.

Victor continued.

"Additionally: If I succeed in my solo run, all spectators receive free entry to next week's tournament."

Pause.

"If I fail... I'll reconsider my management strategy."

The crowd went silent.

Gambling started immediately.

\u003e **[ARMI - RISK ANALYSIS]**
\u003e Team 1 (Management) Win Probability: 34%
\u003e Team 2 (Operations) Win Probability: 28%
\u003e Victor Solo Win Probability: 11%
\u003e Reputation Gain (3/3 Wins): +95% brand loyalty
\u003e Reputation Loss (0/3 Wins): -60% trust, crisis prolonged

Victor closed the interface.

"Let the exhibition begin."

***

**Team 1: Management**

Asterion stood at the arena entrance, massive axe resting on his shoulder.

Valerius adjusted his coat. "This is absurd. We're administrators, not adventurers."

Zip trembled. "Boss, I've never fought a dragon before."

Asterion grunted. "You've never fought anything before."

"THAT'S NOT HELPING!"

The gates opened.

Ignatia waited, wings spread, eyes gleaming.

"**ASTERION. I'VE WANTED THIS FIGHT FOR MONTHS.**"

Asterion grinned. "Let's see if you're worth the salary."

***

**Phase 1**

Ignatia unleashed **Flame Torrent**.

Asterion charged straight into it.

No dodge. No shield. Pure Constitution.

The flames washed over him—he kept running.

Valerius (watching from range): "He's insane."

Zip: "Should I heal him?!"

Valerius: "Not yet. His regeneration is handling it."

Asterion reached Ignatia, axe swinging.

**IMPACT.**

Dragon staggered.

Crowd: "THE MINOTAUR JUST TANKED A DRAGON'S BREATH!"

***

**Phase 2**

Ignatia's wings ignited.

Aerial phase.

She launched upward.

Asterion's axe couldn't reach.

"COWARD!" he bellowed.

**Meteor Dive** incoming.

Asterion braced.

Impact.

HP: 140/220.

Valerius: "Zip! Barrier!"

Zip panicked, fumbling his spell focus.

Ignatia dove again.

Valerius stepped forward, blood magic surging.

Crimson whips materialized, wrapping around Ignatia's wings mid-flight.

He PULLED.

Dragon crashed.

Asterion grappled her neck.

"NOW, ZIP!"

Zip cast **Minor Heal**—shaky, but functional.

Asterion's HP: 140 → 165.

***

**Phase 3**

Ignatia's chest glowed white-hot.

**INFERNO BURST.**

Asterion: "ZIP! BARRIER! NOW!"

Zip's hands shook.

"I—I can't—"

Valerius (calm): "Yes. You can. Focus."

Zip closed his eyes.

**Tier-2 Barrier** materialized—translucent, flickering, but HOLDING.

The explosion went off.

Barrier cracked.

Held.

Shattered.

But they survived.

Combined HP: 12%.

Ignatia (weakened): 31% HP.

Asterion charged one final time.

Valerius blood-drained to slow her.

Zip threw a rock (missed, but distracted her).

Asterion's **final axe swing**: CRITICAL HIT.

Ignatia collapsed.

**VICTORY: 31 minutes, 14 seconds.**

***

The crowd went silent.

Then: **Standing ovation.**

"THE MINOTAUR GRAPPLED A DRAGON!"

"Zip is my new favorite!"

"MANAGEMENT WINS!"

Asterion helped Ignatia to her feet.

She laughed. "**WELL FOUGHT, MINOTAUR. YOU'VE EARNED YOUR PAYCHECK.**"

***

**Team 2: Operations**

Gorg cracked his knuckles.

Sniv checked his poison vials.

Roland... looked conflicted.

"I'm Church of Eternal Light. I shouldn't be enjoying this."

Sniv grinned. "But you are."

Roland (reluctant smile): "...Shut up."

***

**Phase 1**

Gorg charged.

No strategy.

Just rage.

**Flame Torrent** hit him full force.

He didn't care.

"COME AT ME, LIZARD!"

Sniv (from shadows): "GORG, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DODGE!"

Gorg: "DODGING IS FOR COWARDS!"

He swung his club—massive, brutal, effective.

Ignatia HP: 85%.

***

**Phase 2**

Aerial assault.

Ignatia targeted Gorg (he was loudest).

**Meteor Dive.**

Gorg tanked it.

HP: 45/180.

Roland: "He's going to get himself killed."

Sniv: "That's his strategy."

Ignatia dove again.

This time, Sniv was ready.

**Poisoned Net** launched mid-dive.

Hit.

Dragon slowed (poison effect: -30% speed).

Gorg capitalized.

**OVERHEAD SMASH.**

Critical.

Ignatia HP: 52%.

***

**Phase 3**

Ultimate incoming.

**INFERNO BURST.**

Gorg activated **Berserk** (Troll racial ability).

Damage output doubled.

Defense dropped.

Roland saw the math.

Gorg wouldn't survive.

He stepped forward.

"**DIVINE INTERVENTION!**"

Golden barrier surrounded Gorg.

Explosion.

Barrier held.

Gorg survived with 8 HP.

He didn't stop.

**FINAL CLUB SWING.**

Ignatia staggered.

Sniv appeared from shadows.

**Poisoned dagger to dragon's eye.**

Killing blow.

**VICTORY: 28 minutes, 6 seconds.**

Faster than Management.

***

Crowd: "OPERATIONS BEAT MANAGEMENT!"

Post-match.

Roland approached Victor in the observation room.

"I... enjoyed that."

Victor: "You're welcome to participate in future tournaments. As a competitor, not a compliance officer."

Roland (conflicted): "I'll... consider it."

***

**Victor's Solo Run**

The arena gates opened.

Victor stepped in.

No armor.

No weapon.

Just his suit and ARMI interface.

The crowd went silent.

Ignatia regarded him with amusement.

"**YOU'RE SERIOUS.**"

Victor: "Always."

"**THIS WILL BE BRIEF.**"

"We'll see."

***

**Phase 1**

Ignatia unleashed **Flame Torrent**.

Victor activated **[Efficiency Optimization]**.

\u003e **[ARMI - SKILL ACTIVATED]**
\u003e Efficiency Optimization
\u003e Effect: +40% movement speed, -20% enemy attack speed

Victor moved.

Not fast.

Precisely.

ARMI calculated attack trajectory.

He sidestepped **Flame Torrent** by two inches.

No damage.

Ignatia attacked again.

Victor dodged.

Again.

Dodge.

Third time.

Dodge.

Zero damage dealt.

Zero damage taken.

Crowd: "He's just... dancing."

***

**Phase 2**

Ignatia went aerial.

**Meteor Dive** incoming.

Victor didn't dodge this time.

"ARMI. Activate **[Resource Reallocation]**."

\u003e **[ARMI - SKILL ACTIVATED]**
\u003e Resource Reallocation
\u003e Effect: Redirect dungeon mana to user (mana shield + elemental resistance)

Blue barrier materialized.

**Meteor Dive** hit.

Barrier absorbed 80% damage.

Victor HP: 92/100.

Crowd: "HOW IS HE STILL STANDING?!"

***

**Phase 3**

Ignatia's chest glowed.

Ultimate.

**INFERNO BURST.**

Victor stood still.

Didn't run.

Didn't shield.

"ARMI. Activate **[Hostile Acquisition]**."

\u003e **[ARMI - SKILL ACTIVATED]**
\u003e Hostile Acquisition
\u003e Effect: Redirect 40% of incoming damage back to source

Explosion.

Victor took 60% damage: HP 92 → 38.

Ignatia took 40% reflected damage: HP 100% → 60%.

**Dragon damaged herself.**

Crowd: "WHAT JUST HAPPENED?!"

***

Ignatia (weakened): 60% HP.

Victor: 38% HP.

Ignatia prepared another attack.

Victor spoke calmly.

"ARMI. Activate **[Termination Protocol]**."

\u003e **[ARMI  - WARNING]**
\u003e Termination Protocol: Immediately end employee contract
\u003e Target: Ignatia (Dragon Boss - Floor 5)
\u003e Effect: Contract nullified, HP set to 0%

Victor: "Confirmed."

\u003e **[ARMI]**
\u003e **EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT TERMINATED.**
\u003e Ignatia HP: 60% → 0%

Ignatia froze.

Collapsed.

**VICTORY: 19 minutes, 2 seconds.**

NEW RECORD.

***

Crowd: Silent. Confused.

Then someone shouted: "DID HE JUST FIRE HER MID-FIGHT?!"

Victor's voice (via projection): "Ignatia is my employee. I retain the authority to terminate her contract at any time. Including during combat."

Pause.

"She's rehired effective immediately."

Ignatia reappeared, laughing hysterically.

"**YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD. THAT WAS BRILLIANT.**"

The crowd lost their minds.

***

**Arc Resolution**

Evening.

The guilds arrived.

Groll. Kael. Voros.

They'd expected failure.

They witnessed: Three victories. Employee dominance. Victor's impossible solo win.

Groll (bitter): "This changes nothing."

Victor: "It changes everything. You tried to destroy my brand. I turned it into the greatest show Oakhaven's ever seen."

Kael: "You got lucky."

Victor: "I optimized. There's a difference."

Voros (smiling): "Franchise pilot approved. Rivercrest launches in three weeks."

Victor nodded.

The guild cartel: Broken.

\u003e **[ARMI - AFTERMATH REPORT]**
\u003e Exhibition Results: 3/3 Victories (100% success rate)
\u003e Spectators: 92 (100% satisfaction rating)
\u003e Revenue: 4,600 GP (refunds waived per victory condition)
\u003e Brand Loyalty: +95% (cultural phenomenon status CEMENTED)
\u003e Guild Cartel Threat: NEUTRALIZED
\u003e Franchise Expansion: APPROVED (Rivercrest pilot - 3 weeks)

Groll and Kael left without another word.

Voros stayed.

"You know what you did today?"

Victor: "Survived a crisis."

Voros: "No. You built a **legend**. People will talk about this for years."

Victor allowed himself a thin smile.

"Good. Legends are profitable."

***

Late night.

Victor's office.

Alone.

He watched the replay of his solo victory.

The Termination Protocol exploit.

The Consortium's voice echoed in his memory:

*"You were reassigned."*

He'd died once for principle.

Now he was winning for profit.

Somehow, that felt right.

The Ember Trials had started as a revenue solution.

Now they were a movement.

And Victor Kaine—formerly dead corporate analyst—was at the center of it all.

**Arc Complete.**
