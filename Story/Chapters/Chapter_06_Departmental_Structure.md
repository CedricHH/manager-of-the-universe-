# Chapter 6: Departmental Structure

Blood.

Victor opened his eyes to find two goblins tearing at each other's throats three meters from his throne. One had the other pinned, yellow teeth bared, fingers clawing toward exposed jugular.

Around them, the rest of his "workforce" watched with the casual interest of creatures who had seen this a hundred times.

*This is why we can't have nice things.*

He was on his feet before the thought finished, crossing the chamber in four long strides. Not running—never running. Running implied panic. Victor Kaine did not panic.

He grabbed the aggressor by the scruff and hauled him backward with all the authority of a man who had once dragged a screaming CEO out of a board meeting for violating parliamentary procedure.

"Enough."

The goblin snarled, squirming. "Mushroom! Mine! He take—"

"I don't care."

Victor released him with a shove that sent him sprawling. The defender—smaller, bleeding from three parallel scratches across his face—scrambled back, clutching a half-eaten blue mushroom to his chest.

The night watch sat in the corner. Asleep.

*Of course.*

"Sniv."

The small goblin materialized at Victor's elbow. He had been watching from the shadows, clutching his clipboard like a talisman.

"Yes Boss!"

Victor pointed at the sleeping guard. "What was his job?"

"Watch. Keep things quiet. Report problems."

"And did he do any of those things?"

Sniv looked at the chaos, then at the unconscious goblin. His yellow eyes narrowed with something approaching understanding.

"No, Boss. He did not."

"Correct." Victor turned to address the gathered goblins—all fourteen now awake and watching with various degrees of fear and confusion. "This is a teaching moment."

The guard woke to find Victor standing over him.

"The good news," Victor said, "is that I'm not going to hurt you."

Relief flickered across the goblin's face.

"The bad news is that you don't eat today."

The relief died instantly.

"Neither does he." Victor pointed at the aggressor. "Or him. Redundancy in misconduct leads to collective liability."

The defender, mushroom still clutched protectively. "Three goblins caused disruption. Three goblins face consequences."

"But Grak take—" the defender started.

"I. Don't. Care. What Grak did is Grak's problem. What you did—fighting instead of reporting—is your problem. What he did—" Victor jerked a thumb at the sleeping guard "—is negligence."

The goblins stared at him. The concepts were alien. They had lived by survival of the fittest, where strength meant taking and weakness meant starving. The idea that *all* participants in a conflict might face punishment was revolutionary.

> **[ARMI - BEHAVIORAL FRAMEWORK]**

> Subjects: Guard-1 (Negligence), Grak (Aggression), Subject-003 (Unauthorized Combat)
> Penalty: 1 day rations withheld

> Note: Primitive correction protocols. Effective for low-INT populations.

Victor let the silence stretch. Then he pointed at the chamber floor.

"Sit. Everyone. We're having a meeting."

With charcoal retrieved from the old campfire, Victor began drawing on the wall.

The first shape was a square at the top. Inside it, he wrote: **BOSS**.

Below it, connected by a line: **SNIV**.

Below Sniv, three branches spreading outward: **FOOD** | **GUARD** | **LABOR**.

"This is an org chart," Victor announced. "This is how we work."

The goblins stared at the wall with expressions ranging from confusion to fear. They recognized the symbols for 'Boss' and 'Sniv'—those were words they'd heard. The rest was incomprehensible.

Sniv, however, was practically vibrating with enthusiasm. He had never been on a chart before. He had never been *anything* before.

"I'm on the wall," he whispered reverently. "Sniv is on the wall."

"Yes." Victor tapped the box around Sniv's name. "Sniv is my direct report. Everything flows through him. If you have problems, you tell Sniv. Sniv tells me. You don't come to me directly unless Sniv is dead or I say otherwise. Understood?"

Confused nods. Close enough.

"Now. Departments."

He assigned teams with the efficiency of a man who had restructured Fortune 500 companies before breakfast.

**Food Team**: Four goblins responsible for hunting slimes and gathering mushrooms. One became Food-Lead; three reported to him.

**Guard Team**: Three goblins for perimeter security. Rotating shifts. The sleeping guard was stripped of his Lead status—the next largest promoted in his place.

**Labor Team**: Three goblins for sanitation, construction, transportation. Every task that didn't fit elsewhere.

That left Sniv, who reported directly to Victor. Chain of command established: ten workers, three Leads, one COO, one Boss.

> **[ARMI - ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURE]**
> Departmental Structure Implemented
> Departments: 3 (Food Acquisition, Security, General Labor)
> Management Layer: 1 (Sniv - HR/COO equivalent)
> Team Leads: 3 (Reporting to Sniv)
> Workers: 10 (Reporting to Leads)
> Executive: 1 (Victor Kaine)
> Efficiency Projection: +25% over flat hierarchy
> Note: Bureaucracy successfully introduced to pre-industrial species.

Victor drew a crude clock next to the org chart—a circle divided into fourteen segments, each marked with a charcoal notch.

"Time system. We don't have sun here, so we measure by candles." He held up one of the tallow candles they'd found in the previous inhabitant's supplies. "One candle burns for one hour. Work eight candles. Rest four candles. Eat during assigned breaks."

Sniv attempted to translate. "Work until... candle number go from here to here. Then stop. Rest. Then work again."

The goblins stared.

"They don't understand numbers," Victor observed.

"No, Boss. Goblins count: one, two, many."

*Of course they do.*

"Fine. New system." Victor pointed at the candle. "Work until this candle burns down. New candle starts. Work until that burns down. Then rest until third candle burns down. Then eat. Repeat."

Simpler. Three candles marked the complete cycle. Even creatures who couldn't count past two could track that.

"Now," Victor continued, "we need to discuss the reporting structure."

He pulled Sniv aside while the others digested the new organizational reality.

---

"Your job," Victor said quietly, so only Sniv could hear, "is to make sure I don't have to deal with every small problem. You count the supplies. You track who's working. You report problems before they become crises."

Sniv nodded seriously. "Sniv count. Sniv watch. Sniv tell Boss important things only."

"Correct. And you don't hit anyone."

Sniv's face fell slightly.

"If someone disobeys, you tell me. I handle discipline. You are management—not enforcement."

"Sniv is..." the goblin struggled with the word. "Middleman?"

"Manager," Victor corrected. "You manage. You don't fight."

"Ma-na-ger." Sniv rolled the word around his mouth like a delicacy. "Sniv likes. Sniv is Manager."

The small goblin straightened his salvaged tie—a strip of cloth he'd found in the dead adventurer's pack—and adjusted his clipboard with newfound dignity.

*He's adapting faster than expected. The learning curve will accelerate.*

> **[ARMI - PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT]**

As the goblins dispersed to their assigned tasks—reluctantly, imperfectly, but moving—Sniv returned with the morning census.

"Boss. Sniv has numbers."

Victor accepted the clipboard. Sniv had been learning to make marks—not reading, not yet, but he could scratch tallies.

"Our floor: fourteen goblins. Fed. Mostly obedient."

"And the others?"

Sniv's expression darkened. "Floors above—Floor One, Two, Three—have other goblins. Many other goblins. Headcount: 28 units (Competitor Market Presence). They don't follow Boss."

"Hostile?"

"They take mushrooms from patches near stairs. They watch us. They wait."

*Competition for resources. Classic territorial dispute.*

Victor considered the numbers. Fourteen versus twenty-eight. His goblins were fed, rested, and beginning to understand basic organization. The others were probably starving, desperate, and aggressive.

In a straight fight, twenty-eight beats fourteen every time.

But fights were rarely straight.

"They're threatening our food supply," Victor said. It wasn't a question.

"Yes, Boss. If they keep taking mushrooms, we run out. Maybe... ten days? Maybe less."

The math was simple. Either Victor expanded to secure more territory, or he watched his organization slowly starve.

*Defend and die slowly, or attack and risk dying quickly.*

He thought of his former life. The boardroom battles. The hostile takeovers. The moment when you realized that staying still meant losing, and moving forward meant risk.

The strong companies didn't wait to be acquired. They acquired first.

"Sniv."

"Yes, Boss?"

"How many of those twenty-eight can actually fight?"

Sniv thought carefully. "Maybe... half? Others are old, or hurt, or small like Sniv was."

Fourteen versus fourteen. Better odds.

And Victor had something the other goblins didn't: **structure**.

He looked at his workforce. Underfed. Undertrained. Three of them currently sulking because they'd been denied breakfast.

But they had positions. They had a chain of command. They had begun—however primitively—to think of themselves as parts of a whole rather than individuals struggling for survival.

*Organization beats chaos. Always.*

"Tomorrow," Victor said, loud enough for all to hear, "we take Floor Three."

The goblins froze. Even the Leads looked uncertain. Floor Three was enemy territory. Floor Three meant war.

But no one argued.

That, Victor noted, was progress.
