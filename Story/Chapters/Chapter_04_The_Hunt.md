# Chapter 4: The Hunt

Victor calculated the rate of decay in the air; it was a leading indicator of untapped market potential on Floor Two.

Victor moved carefully, one hand trailing along the slick stone wall for balance. Behind him, Sniv padded silently on bare feet, followed by three goblins who had been "volunteered" for this expedition by virtue of being the least likely to stab Victor in the back.

Their names—if they had names—didn't matter yet. What mattered was that they could follow basic instructions and carry things.

Marcus's torch sputtered in Victor's other hand. Thirty minutes of light, maybe less. The flame had been reliable when the hero was alive, probably enchanted to burn indefinitely. Now, with its owner dead, the magic was fading.

*Note: Magic items decay without owner mana. Factor into asset valuations.*

The descent took ten minutes. The stairway was natural stone worn smooth by centuries of traffic—goblin feet, monster claws, the occasional adventurer who never returned. Moisture ran down the walls in thin rivulets, and the air grew warmer with each step.

Then Floor Two opened before them.

Victor stopped. The torch illuminated a cavern that stretched beyond its light's reach, but what he could see was enough to understand why the goblins called this place "the wet floor."

Bioluminescent mushrooms dotted every surface—the walls, the ceiling, clusters rising from the floor like frozen fountains. They glowed in shades of blue and green, casting the entire space in shifting underwater light. The floor was covered in a thin layer of water, maybe an inch deep, fed by drips from above.

And everywhere—*everywhere*—there were slimes.

Translucent blobs of jelly, ranging from the size of a fist to the size of a small dog, oozed across every available surface. They moved slowly, mindlessly, consuming the mushrooms and the moss and anything organic that had the misfortune to sit still too long.

Victor activated Performance Review on the nearest specimen.

> **[PERFORMANCE REVIEW - Basic Slime]**
> Level: 2
> HP: 15/15
> Type: Ooze (Acidic)
> Behavior: Passive (attacks only when touched or threatened)
> Drops:
> - Slime Jelly (100% drop rate) - Edible with tolerance
> - Acid Sac (25% drop rate) - Corrosive, valuable
> Market Value: 2 GP (base), 5 GP (with Acid Sac)
> Note: Infinite respawn from environmental moisture. Cannot be fully cleared.

*Infinite respawn. Self-sustaining resource. This isn't a threat—it's a farm.*

Victor turned to his team. The goblins were hanging back, their yellow eyes wide with the instinctive fear of creatures that had lost tribe members to these oozing predators. Even Sniv's movements had slowed, his eyes constantly scanning for exits.

"Listen carefully," Victor said. "We're not here to fight. We're here to harvest. The slimes are slow, predictable, and they only attack when threatened. Our job is to threaten them on our terms."

He pointed to the nearest slime—a medium-sized blob oozing along the base of a mushroom cluster.

"Surround it. Use sticks, rocks, anything with reach. Drive it into a corner where it can't escape. Once it's trapped, one quick strike to the core kills it. Don't touch the outer membrane—that's where the acid is concentrated."

The goblins exchanged uncertain glances.

Victor's voice hardened. "Anyone who doesn't follow instructions goes hungry. Move."

They moved.

The first kill was messy. One goblin got too close, caught a splash of acid across his forearm, and screamed loud enough to echo through the cavern. But the slime was cornered, exactly as Victor had directed, and Sniv finished it with a rock to its gelatinous center.

The blob collapsed, quivering once, then going still. In its place: a handful of translucent jelly that glowed faintly in the mushroom light.

> **[ARMI]**
> Balance: 0 GP | Transaction: [Kill Logging]
> Cost: 0 GP | Status: APPROVED
> Target: Basic Slime. XP Distributed.

Victor picked up the jelly. It was cool to the touch, slightly sticky, and smelled like ammonia mixed with something almost sweet.

"Sniv."

The small goblin looked up.

"Taste it."

Sniv's eyes widened. "Boss... Boss taste first?"

"Delegation is a core management competency. You have the honor."

Sniv stared at the jelly in Victor's hand. Then, with the resignation of a creature who had survived years of abuse by doing whatever he was told, he took a small piece and put it in his mouth.

He chewed. Swallowed. Waited.

Nothing happened.

"Is... okay," Sniv said slowly. "Burns throat a little. Like bad mushroom. But fills belly."

Victor allowed himself a thin smile. "Food source confirmed. Let's get to work."

The next two hours were the most productive of Victor's new life.

The "funnel technique"—as Victor mentally termed it—proved devastatingly effective. The goblins learned to work as a unit, driving slimes into prepared kill zones where they could be dispatched with minimal risk. The injured goblin's burn served as an object lesson in workplace safety; after that, everyone maintained proper distance from the acidic membranes.

Victor observed his team with the detached satisfaction of a manager watching a training program take hold. The three volunteers had started as sullen, reluctant conscripts. Now they moved with purpose.

They anticipated each other's positions. They even developed a crude signaling system—clicks and grunts that coordinated their flanking movements.

*Remarkable. Give creatures a task, a reward structure, and consequences for failure, and productivity follows. Universal principle.*

By the halfway point, they had developed a rhythm. Spot. Surround. Corner. Kill. Collect. The efficiency improved with each cycle, the time between kills shrinking as muscle memory replaced conscious thought.

> **[ARMI - PROGRESS REPORT]**
> Slimes Eliminated: 15
> Loot Collected:
> - Slime Jelly x15 (Sufficient for 15 meals)
> - Acid Sac x3 (Stored for future application)
> XP Gained (Victor): 15 (Coordination bonus)
> Estimated Market Value: 30 GP (if liquidated)
> Status: Operational efficiency improving.

Thirty GP. Not enough for any major skills, but enough to prove a concept. Resources could be gathered. Value could be created. The dungeon wasn't just a death trap—it was an economy waiting to be optimized.

Victor was cataloguing their inventory when movement caught his eye.

Something larger than a slime. Faster. Covered in matted gray fur.

A rat. But not the small, scurrying kind that infested even the cleanest corporate offices. This was a *dungeon* rat—the size of a large cat, with yellowed teeth and eyes that gleamed with animal cunning.

It was eating a dead slime, tearing chunks of jelly from the remains with obvious satisfaction.

*Protein.*

Victor pointed. "New target."

The goblins readied their improvised weapons. Sniv clutched his rock.

The rat saw them. Instead of fighting, it ran—a blur of gray disappearing into a tunnel Victor hadn't noticed before.

"Follow it."

They followed.

The tunnel was narrow, barely wide enough for Victor to pass without scraping his shoulders. The rat smell intensified with every step—musk and waste and something that might have been rotting meat.

Then the tunnel opened into a nest.

Victor stopped. The goblins piled up behind him.

This wasn't one rat.

This was twelve rats. Twelve dungeon rats arranged in a loose semicircle around a central mass of bedding. And at the center, larger than the others by at least fifty percent, sat an **Alpha Rat** with scarred ears and teeth that gleamed like yellowed daggers.

> **[PERFORMANCE REVIEW - Alpha Rat]**
> Level: 5
> HP: 85/85
> Type: Beast (Pack Leader)
> Behavior: Aggressive (territorial)
> Pack Size: 12 (including Alpha)
> Threat Assessment: LETHAL (current party configuration)
> Recommendation: Retreat and reinforce.

The Alpha hissed. The pack closed in, cutting off the tunnel exit.

Victor's mind raced through options. Fight? Twelve to five, with an enemy two levels above their average combatant. Run? The exit was blocked. Negotiate?

"ARMI. Communication options with rats?"

> **[ARMI - QUERY RESPONSE]**
> Species: Dungeon Rat
> Intelligence: Minimal (instinct-driven)
> Communication: Pheromone-based, territorial scent marking
> Negotiation Success Rate: 2%
> Note: Verbal communication ineffective. Behavioral cues may be interpreted.

Two percent. Even worse than the goblins.

But Victor had something the goblins hadn't possessed during that first negotiation.

He had something the rats wanted.

"Sniv. The jelly. Throw one toward the Alpha."

Sniv hesitated for only a second. Then he reached into the collection bag and hurled a glob of slime jelly toward the massive rat.

The Alpha's hiss cut off mid-sound. Its nose twitched. It sniffed the jelly cautiously, then with increasing interest.

Then it ate.

The other rats watched their leader. When the Alpha didn't attack them for proximity to the food, they relaxed slightly. The aggressive posture softened.

Victor reached slowly into the bag and pulled out another jelly. He held it up, letting the bioluminescent light catch its surface.

"More where that came from," he said quietly, knowing the rat couldn't understand the words but might understand the tone. The offering. "Lots more. Every day."

The Alpha finished chewing. Its black eyes fixed on Victor—not with hunger now, but with something almost calculating.

> **[ARMI - NOTIFICATION]**
> Behavioral Assessment Updated
> Alpha Rat Response: NEUTRAL (bribery successful)
> Pack Status: Non-hostile (temporary)
> Note: Relationship requires ongoing investment. Suggest regular feeding schedule.

Victor allowed himself to breathe.

"I think," he said slowly, "we just invented pest control through payroll."

The Alpha rat watched him, tail twitching in rhythmic greed. Deeper in the nest, something large shifted—a sound that didn't come from a rat.
