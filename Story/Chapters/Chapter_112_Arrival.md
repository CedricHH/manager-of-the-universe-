# Chapter 112 - Arrival

Four minutes in the void.

Dimensional transit felt like reality ending—no up, no down, only mana currents and ARMI beacon guiding through impossible geometries. Victor's equilibrium screamed. Nausea built.

Resh stood unaffected, third Tier 4 transit, amber eyes tracking energy flows most humans couldn't perceive.

Sera analyzed even mid-journey, fingers moving through data projections only she could see in the chaos.

Then: solidification.

**Terra-Solvaris. Solvara. The fallen capital.**

Sound hit first—artillery barrage three miles northwest, small arms fire closer (800 meters), screaming southeast (civilians), building collapse echoing through ruins.

Victor's eyes adjusted.

Former grand capital: rubble. Shattered administrative spires. Burned government complexes. Crater where royal palace stood—fifty meters across, still smoking. Three faction checkpoints visible in the distance: Revolutionary red flags north, Theocrat white banners east, Merchant Coalition gold south.

Smell: Smoke, cordite, death. Bodies in streets, civilian clothing, weeks old based on decay patterns. Nobody collecting them.

ARMI alert flashed: **Mana density 340% baseline. Environmental hazard: Magic volatility HIGH.**

Resh deployed barrier immediately—Tier 5 rated, shimmering translucent dome, thirty-meter radius coverage. "Landing zone secured. Scanning for immediate threats."

Sera activated scrying focus—long-range magical sensors sweeping surroundings. "Fifty-plus civilians in ruins, scavenging. They've seen us. Scattering." Pause. "Warlord patrol, four hundred meters east. Twelve soldiers. Professional formation. Approaching."

Victor activated ARMI economic scan. Data overlay appeared—trade routes (broken), supply lines (contested), resource distribution (catastrophic). Pre-war Solvara: 1.2 million population, 840,000 GP annual GDP. Current readings: ~400,000 population remaining, GDP: 12,000 GP.

**Ninety-eight-point-five percent economic collapse.**

This was Expected Value failure made tangible. Eight hundred thousand dead or displaced. Infrastructure annihilated. If Consortium authorized Terminal Resolution, two-point-four billion across the planet faced this.

The calculation wasn't abstract anymore.

"Victor." Resh's voice cut through analysis. "Patrol leader signaling. We have ninety seconds before confrontation."

Warlord soldiers approached in professional formation—Level 9-11 average based on equipment quality, enchanted armor, disciplined spacing. Not bandits. **Real military.**

The patrol leader—scarred, mid-thirties, captain's insignia—stopped twenty meters out. Raised weapon (not aimed yet, but ready).

Shouted in accented Common: "Consortium operatives! By authority of General Kael Dravik, Protector of the Central Bank, you are ordered to surrender for processing!"

Victor looked at Resh. "Processing means interrogation. Possibly execution."

"I can handle twelve," Resh replied. "Reinforcements—question mark."

Sixty seconds until contact.

First test: Could Victor negotiate bullets?

---

Victor stepped forward, hands visible, Consortium credentials displayed—glowing seal materializing above his palm.

"Independent arbitrators under Consortium authority. We're here to negotiate capital recovery and government stabilization. Not combatants."

The patrol leader approached cautiously, weapon lowered but not holstered. Identified via ARMI scan: **Captain Torin Vex, Level 12 Fighter, 14-year veteran**. Burn scars on left arm, combat fatigue visible.

"General Dravik doesn't negotiate with Consortium vultures," Torin said flatly. "You're here to steal **our** gold. The Central Bank belongs to those who hold it."

Victor analyzed the statement.

"Our gold"—Warlords claimed ownership. "Consortium vultures"—negative perception, expected exploitation. But no immediate attack—protocol suggested capture first, kill later. Dravik wanted intelligence.

"The Consortium didn't send us to steal," Victor replied. "Sent us to recover **and** stabilize. Civil war costs you more than the gold is worth. Eighteen months fighting—how many soldiers lost? How much territory can you hold with ten percent of Solvaris while four factions want you dead?"

Torin hesitated. Truth landed.

"What's your proposal?"

"Safe passage to neutral ground. We establish contact with all factions—including Dravik. Whoever offers best stability plan gets Consortium support."

"General doesn't trust Consortium," Torin countered. "Last 'arbitrators' tried stealing vault codes. Dravik executed them. Why should you be different?"

"Because I'm not here to steal. I'm here to make a deal. Dravik can keep the gold if he stabilizes the government. Consortium wants repayment, not possession. Dead planet pays nothing."

Silence. Artillery barrage intensified—different direction. Revolutionary offensive starting.

Torin's decision showed in his posture. "I'll escort you to Forward Operating Base. General Dravik decides your fate. Resist, and we kill you. Comply, and maybe you live."

Sera whispered: "Thirty percent trap probability. Seventy percent Dravik wants intelligence before deciding. Survivable odds."

Resh: "I can fight our way out. Your call."

Victor calculated: Meeting Dravik first= intelligence advantage, showed strength (didn't run), established direct contact with faction controlling capital. Risk: imprisonment/execution. Reward: Central Bank access negotiation.

"We comply," Victor said. "Take us to Dravik."

---

Escort through Solvara told stories words couldn't.

Bodies uncollected—civilians, malnutrition evident before death, clothing indicated non-combatants. Makeshift graves numbered in hundreds, fresh excavation visible. Refugee camps burned out, tents collapsed, belongings scattered.

Revolutionary checkpoint 200 meters north exchanged warning shots with Warlord patrol. No engagement—performative aggression. Stalemate.

Infrastructure destroyed systematically. Residential blocks collapsed (artillery damage), water main broken (streets flooded), hospital bombed (red cross still visible on rubble), school fortified (children's artwork on walls behind sandbag walls).

ARMI economic scan confirmed previous readings. Pre-war prosperity visible in architecture—wealth, planning, civilization. Current status: catastrophic collapse.

Victor internalized it. *This is what failure looks like. If I fail, two-point-four billion see this. Expected value calculation: two hundred fifty-two million lives saved. Now I understand what that means.*

Sera gathered intelligence continuously—photographing checkpoint positions, noting patrol patterns, mapping supply routes. Whispered: "Warlords control Central Bank and two-hundred-meter security perimeter. Beyond that: contested. They can't project power. Not occupying—besieged."

Resh's tactical assessment: "Three checkpoints surrounding this sector. Warlords trapped. Hiding behind vault walls with stolen gold, waiting."

Passing Revolutionary checkpoint—soldier shouted: "Dravik's dogs! When we free the Bank, we'll hang you all!"

Torin ignored. Professional discipline maintained.

Passing Theocrat banner—white-robed mage observed silently. Intelligence gathering. Didn't engage.

Victor realized: All factions watching the Bank. Waiting for weakness. Stalemate because breaking Dravik's fortress required catastrophic casualties. Consortium arrival changed equation—new variable all factions would recalculate around.

**Arrival: Ironhold Bunker Complex.**

Former government treasury, now fortress. Enchanted walls (anti-magic wards visible, Tier 4 defensive spells), artillery emplacements covering all approaches, Central Bank visible beyond—massive structure, vault doors sealed, Dravik's black flag flying.

ARMI scan: 180 soldiers inside, 40 combat mages, supply stockpile (47 days remaining at current consumption rate).

**Siege status**: Could hold indefinitely if supplies maintained. Could not expand territory. Trapped.

Torin to gate guards: "Consortium agents. General's interrogation. Category Orange—valuable intelligence."

Gates opened.

Victor, Resh, Sera entered Dravik's stronghold.

---

The interrogation room: Former treasury counting chamber. War room now. Maps covering walls—faction positions, attack vectors, supply routes marked in different colors. Central table displayed holographic tactical projection (magical, real-time battle data updating).

**General Kael Dravik entered.**

Age 47, grizzled. Former Royal Guard Commander—22 years service visible in bearing. Level 21 Tactician/Commander (highest level Victor had encountered). Scars: facial sword slash, missing left pinky. Eyes: calculating, intelligent, **dangerous**.

"Consortium sent three teams before you," Dravik began without preamble. "First team tried bribing my officers. Failed. Executed. Second team attempted vault infiltration. Failed. Executed. Third team negotiated, seemed reasonable, tried poisoning my dinner. Failed. Executed slowly."

Pause.

"Why shouldn't you be team number four on the execution list?"

Victor's response came direct, no flattery: "Because I'm not here to trick you. I'm here to make you an offer. You have sixteen-point-seven million gold. Consortium wants repayment. You want legitimacy. Let's trade."

Dravik laughed—bitter, sharp. "Legitimacy from Consortium? You're vultures picking corpses. You don't care about Solvaris. You want gold extracted and profits booked. Two-point-four billion dead or alive—irrelevant to your spreadsheets."

Victor didn't deny it. "True. Consortium will authorize Terminal Resolution if recovery fails. Orbital bombardment, complete planetary liquidation. But **I** care about return on investment. Dead planets pay nothing. I need you alive to repay debt."

Dravik studied Victor with new attention. "You're different. Previous teams lied. You're honest." He gestured to hologram. "Here's situation: Four factions want me dead. I control Bank because I'm only one willing to defend it. Revolutionaries would redistribute the gold—lost to corruption within six months. Merchants would embezzle it. Theocrats would tithe it to their gods. Legitimists too weak to hold it."

"I'm the **only** faction keeping Consortium investment safe. And you want me to surrender it?"

"No," Victor countered. "I want you to **leverage** it. Sixteen-point-seven million gold. You're sitting on fortune while besieged with forty-seven days supplies remaining. **Use** the gold. Hire mercenaries. Buy Merchant Coalition trade routes. Fund Legitimist territorial claim. Build coalition instead of fortress."

Dravik's interest showed. "Coalition with who? Everyone hates Warlords."

"Everyone hates you **now**. Change the narrative. Become 'Guardian of National Treasury' not 'Thief.' Propose temporary government—Dravik as **Finance Minister**, not dictator. Other factions provide legitimacy, you provide capital. Mutual dependency."

Silence. Dravik processing.

ARMI alert: **EXTERNAL THREAT. Revolutionary offensive. Artillery intensifying. 300+ infantry mobilizing toward Ironhold Bunker.**

Dravik to Victor: "Consortium luck. Revolutionaries attack **now**. We continue conversation after I kill them. Or you prove value—help defend this fortress."

Resh grinned, fangs showing. "Finally."

---

Alarm blared. Fortress scrambled—soldiers to positions, mages to wall enchantments, artillery crews loading.

Dravik to officers: "Revolutionary assault, northern approach. Eight hundred strong. Standard counter-siege. Artillery priority fire. Mage barrier reinforcement."

To Victor: "Your team combat capable?"

"Very," Resh confirmed.

"Then fight or die. Revolutionaries breach fortress, they execute everyone inside. **Including** Consortium arbitrators."

Sera's scrying activated: "Confirmed. Eight hundred twelve Revolutionary infantry. Forty-two combat mages. Tribune Cassian Vex leading personally. This isn't probe—full offensive."

Victor analyzed Revolutionary timing. Deliberate. Consortium arrival spooked them—worried about Bank alliance forming. Attacking **now** prevented negotiation.

Strategic calculation:
- Help Dravik = Revolutionary faction hostile permanently
- Refuse help = Dravik executes them, Revolutionaries **still** hostile (Consortium association)
- Dimensional extraction beacon = Mission failure, return in disgrace

No good options. Only least-bad choice.

"We'll help defend," Victor told Dravik. "After battle, we negotiate proper terms. Partnership discussion, not interrogation."

Dravik's grin: "If we survive, I'll negotiate. If we die, Consortium gets nothing. Either way, you're committed."

Artillery barrage hit outer walls. Shields absorbed impact. Ground shook. Dust fell from ceiling.

Resh drew twin blades. "Defensive perimeter, Level 21 tactical commander, eight hundred hostiles incoming. Better than Oakhaven already."

Sera: "Coordinating intelligence—Revolutionary mage positions, formation weak points."

Victor: "Resource allocation. Make this siege unprofitable for Cassian Vex."

Dravik's hologram updated: Revolutionary forces 200 meters out. Breach attempt imminent.

*Oakhaven was economics,* Victor thought. *This is war. Resh was right—Solvaris doesn't negotiate. It kills. Time to prove bullets can be expensive.*

Artillery roared. The siege began.

> **[TERRA-SOLVARIS: DAY 1]**  
> **[REVOLUTIONARY OFFENSIVE: ACTIVE]**  
> **[FORTRESS DEFENSE: COMMITTED]**  
> **[4-MONTH COUNTDOWN: 119 DAYS, 23 HOURS REMAINING]**
