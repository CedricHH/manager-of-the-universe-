# Chapter 66: The Auditor

The letter arrived via registered magical courier—the expensive kind that required a signature in blood.

Victor signed.

The courier vanished in a puff of expensive smoke, leaving behind a sealed envelope embossed with the Bank's gilded crest. Victor opened it with a letter knife (he'd bought one specifically for opening threatening correspondence).

**MANDATORY COMPLIANCE INSPECTION**

To: Mr. Victor Kaine, Administrator

Per Loan Agreement Clause 89-F ("Lender Right to Verify Asset Status"), the Gilded Ledger hereby exercises its contractual right to conduct a full operational audit of Dungeon Insolvia.

**Inspector**: Mr. Thaddeus Crow, Senior Compliance Officer
**Date**: Tomorrow, 10:00 AM Sharp
**Duration**: As long as necessary
**Required Access**: All dungeon floors, financial records, employee interviews, structural assessments

**Non-compliance will result in immediate loan acceleration and forfeiture proceedings.**

We trust you will cooperate fully.

— Director Malcom, Senior Loans Officer

Victor read it twice.

Then he smiled.

"Valerius!" he called.

The accountant appeared, still holding a half-eaten sandwich. "Boss?"

Victor handed him the letter. "We're being audited."

Valerius went pale. The sandwich dropped.

"They're triggering Clause 89-F," Valerius whispered. "Boss, that's the nuclear option. If the auditor finds *anything*—missing paperwork, unsafe conditions, revenue discrepancies—they can call the entire loan due. All 10,000 GP. Immediately."

"9,500," Victor corrected. "We paid down 500 via the interest waiver."

"That's not helping!"

Victor sat down, pulling up the loan contract on his desk. All 47 pages of it. He'd read it three times already, but this time he was looking for something specific.

**Clause 89-F: Compliance Inspection Rights**

The lender may, at its discretion, conduct an on-site inspection to verify:
1. Asset condition and maintenance
2. Revenue accuracy and financial transparency
3. Compliance with all applicable Crown Laws
4. Operational risk factors

If the inspection reveals *material misrepresentation*, the lender may declare default.

Victor highlighted the phrase: *material misrepresentation*.

"Define 'material,'" Victor muttered.

Valerius groaned. "Anything the auditor wants it to mean. It's a trap, Boss. Malcom is sending someone to *find* violations. This isn't an audit. It's an execution."

"Then we don't give him anything to find," Victor said. "We have 24 hours. Here's what we're going to do."

***

**The Preparation**

Victor spent the next 18 hours turning the dungeon into a bureaucrat's wet dream.

**Floor 1: Goblin Operations**
- Employee files: Alphabetized, laminated, notarized
- Work schedules: Posted on bulletin boards with gold-leaf lettering
- Safety equipment: Sniv now had a helmet (he wore it upside down, but it counted)
- Break room: Installed. Complete with a suggestion box (empty, but present)

**Floor 2: Slime Management**
- pH testing logs: Updated hourly
- Containment protocols: Printed in three languages (Common, Goblin, Slime)
- Health inspections: Roland had signed off on them (Victor asked nicely)
- Fire extinguishers: Installed every 50 feet (for acid slimes, somehow)

**Floor 3: Minotaur Arena**
- Safety rails: Installed around the pit
- First-aid station: Fully stocked (mostly healing slimes in jars)
- Asterion's employment contract: Framed and hung on the wall
- Insurance policy: Victor had bought one yesterday (it cost 50 GP but covered "Minotaur-related Incidents")

**Floor 4: Jungle of Avarice**
- Mosquito breeding pens: Labeled with scientific taxonomy
- Gorg's contract: Signed, witnessed, filed in triplicate
- Revenue projections: Printed on vellum in calligraphy

Valerius stared at the transformed dungeon. "This is insane."

"This is *compliance*," Victor corrected. "The auditor can't fault perfection."

"But the mosquito farm—"

"Is legally defensible. I checked with Crown Legal. Once the Bank deployed the sprites on my property without a harvest restriction clause, any 'naturally occurring byproducts' default to the landlord. Precedent: *Crown v. Beekeepers Guild*, Year 1391."

Valerius blinked. "You researched medieval property law?"

"I researched *everything*," Victor said.

He pulled up his mental interface, running probabilities.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Threat Assessment: Hostile Audit**
> **Auditor Objective**: Find material misrepresentation (trigger default)
> **Victor's Counter-Strategy**: Eliminate all attack vectors
> **Compliance Investment**: 127 GP (paperwork, equipment, permits)
> **Expected ROI**: Avoid 9,500 GP loan recall = 7,450% return

Three scenarios:

**Scenario A**: Auditor finds violations → Loan recalled → Victor bankrupt
**Probability**: 0% (if preparation complete)

**Scenario B**: Auditor finds zero violations → Returns empty-handed → Malcom escalates
**Probability**: 27% (likely outcome if defensive only)

**Scenario C**: Auditor finds zero violations + Victor pitches expansion → Bank forced to engage
**Probability**: 73% (if executed correctly)

Option C wasn't just survival. It was offense disguised as compliance.

"Valerius," Victor said. "Draft the Loot Futures 2.0 proposal. I want numbers that are aggressive but defensible. 15,000 GP loan. Floor 5 unlock. Volcanic biome."

Valerius stared. "You're going to ask for *more* money? During a hostile audit?"

"I'm going to make rejecting me more expensive than funding me," Victor corrected. "Now get some sleep. The auditor arrives in six hours."

***

**The Auditor**

Mr. Thaddeus Crow arrived at exactly 10:00 AM.

He was thin—uncomfortably so—with pale skin, wire-rimmed spectacles, and a black suit that looked like it had been ironed with a ruler. His briefcase was enchanted; Victor could see the faint glow of Truth Detection runes etched into the leather.

He did not smile.

He did not offer a handshake.

He simply stated: "Mr. Kaine. I am here to verify asset condition per Loan Agreement Section 89-F. Refusal to cooperate constitutes breach of contract. Do you consent to this inspection?"

"Of course," Victor said warmly. "Welcome to Dungeon Insolvia. Would you like the standard tour, or the premium experience?"

Crow stared at him.

"This is not tourism, Mr. Kaine. I require immediate access to: floor layouts, revenue statements, employee contracts, structural integrity reports, and hazard assessments. Failure to provide documentation will be noted."

Victor handed him a binder.

Five hundred pages. Indexed. Cross-referenced. Bound in leather.

Crow opened it. Flipped through the first section. Then the second.

His expression didn't change, but Victor saw his left eye twitch.

"This is..." Crow paused. "...comprehensive."

"I read the contract," Victor said simply. "All 47 pages. Shall we begin the tour?"

***

**Floor 1: Immaculate Conditions**

Crow inspected the goblin quarters with a magnifying glass.

He checked the ventilation (adequate). The lighting (meets Crown standard). The sanitation (surprisingly good). He interviewed Sniv.

"State your employment status," Crow said, pen poised.

"Sniv is... Dungeon Manager!" Sniv said proudly, adjusting his upside-down helmet. "Sniv has dental!"

Crow wrote: *Employee satisfaction: High*.

He moved to the work schedules. Goblins were assigned 8-hour shifts. Breaks every 2 hours. Overtime pay at 1.5x rate.

"You formed a union," Crow noted.

"For tax purposes," Victor explained. "Section 14 of the Labor Code allows collective bargaining to reduce payroll complexity. I consolidated 47 individual contracts into one master agreement. Efficiency improved 23%."

Crow took more notes.

***

**Floor 2: Slime Protocols**

The slimes were arranged in perfect geometric formations. Each had a labeled tank. Each tank had a pH meter. Each meter had a logbook.

Crow pulled a random logbook. Checked the entries.

"pH 6.8, 6.7, 6.9, 6.8..." he read aloud. "Consistent."

"We monitor hourly," Victor said. "Prevents acid burns."

Crow inspected a healing slime. It jiggled happily.

"Health inspection certificate?" Crow asked.

Victor handed him a signed form from Sir Roland.

**Royal Compliance Office**
**Certification of Non-Hazardous Magical Entities**
**Status**: APPROVED

Crow's jaw tightened.

"Moving on," he said.

***

**Floor 3: The Arena**

Asterion stood in the center of the pit, arms crossed. He had been briefed.

"State your employment terms," Crow demanded.

Asterion rumbled, "I am Security Chief. Salary: 50 GP per month. Benefits: Full dental, hazard pay, performance bonuses. I have reviewed my contract and find it... acceptable."

Crow looked up at the massive minotaur. "Are you satisfied with working conditions?"

Asterion paused. Then, with perfect deadpan delivery: "The break room has coffee now. I am... content."

Crow scribbled: *No labor violations detected*.

Victor almost smiled.

***

**Floor 4: The Jungle**

They descended into the humid air of the Jungle. Gorg was practicing his "theatrical roar" in the background. Vines hung from the ceiling. Somewhere, an enchanted parrot squawked.

And in the corner, surrounded by glass terrariums, were the mosquito breeding pens.

Crow stopped.

Stared.

"What," he said slowly, "is that?"

Victor gestured to the setup. "Renewable mana resource extraction. We're cultivating Financial Monitoring Sprites for their crystallized cores. 5 GP per unit. Fully sustainable."

Crow's pen hovered above his notepad. "You are *farming* the Bank's surveillance system."

"The mosquitoes were deployed on my property without a harvest restriction clause. Per *Crown v. Beekeepers Guild* (1391), any naturally occurring byproducts generated on leased land default to the leaseholder. I filed the appropriate permits with Crown Agriculture."

Victor handed him another form.

**Magical Livestock Registration**
**Species**: Financial Monitoring Sprite
**Purpose**: Mana Core Extraction
**Status**: APPROVED

Crow read it. Then read it again.

His hands trembled slightly.

"This is... highly unorthodox."

"Is it non-compliant?" Victor asked.

A long, painful silence.

"...No," Crow finally admitted.

Victor smiled. "Excellent. Now, let's discuss expansion opportunities."

***

**The Proposal**

They returned to Victor's office. Crow sat stiffly, briefcase on his lap.

Victor slid a document across the desk.

**LOOT FUTURES 2.0: EXPANSION PROPOSAL**

- **Amount Requested**: 15,000 GP
- **Purpose**: Floor 5 development (Volcanic Biome)
- **Projected ROI**: 200% over 18 months
- **Collateral**: Mosquito farm yields (1,800 GP/year) + Floor 4 revenue (12% APR)
- **Interest Rate**: 4.5% (preferential rate for existing clients)

Crow stared at the document like it was cursed.

"You want," he said slowly, "a *second* loan. While being audited for the *first* one."

"Your audit confirmed our operational solvency," Victor said. "Zero violations. Zero discrepancies. This is a prime investment opportunity. Unless the Gilded Ledger prefers to let the **Bank of Sterling** fund our expansion?"

Crow's eye twitched again.

The Bank of Sterling was the Gilded Ledger's primary competitor.

"I will... relay your proposal to Director Malcom," Crow said carefully.

He stood. Closed his briefcase. Walked to the door.

Then he paused.

Turned.

"Mr. Kaine. You are either the most competent debtor I have ever audited... or the most dangerous."

Victor leaned back in his chair. "Why not both?"

Crow left without another word.

***

After the door closed, Valerius emerged from under the desk (where he'd been hiding).

"Boss... did you just turn a hostile audit into a loan application?"

"No," Victor said. "I turned it into a *bidding war*. If Malcom says no, I'll send the same proposal to three other banks. He'll approve it just to keep competitors out."

Valerius sat down heavily. "You're insane."

"I prefer 'strategically aggressive,'" Victor corrected.

He pulled up his mental interface.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Audit Result**: ZERO VIOLATIONS FOUND
> **Compliance Score**: 100%
> **Risk Assessment**: Auditor psychologically destabilized
> **Strategic Outcome**: Loan request submitted during hostile inspection
> **Probability of Approval**: 73%

Down in the jungle, the fifteen remaining monitoring mosquitoes hovered silently, transmitting every word back to Malcom.

Victor waved at one.

"Tell your boss I'm waiting for his answer."

---

**STATUS**: Audit survived. Second loan proposal pending. Bank forced to choose: Fund Victor or lose him to rivals.
