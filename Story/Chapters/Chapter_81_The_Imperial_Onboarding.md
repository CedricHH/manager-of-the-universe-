# Chapter 81: The Imperial Onboarding

The interior of the obsidian carriage didn't feel like a vehicle. To Victor Kaine, it felt like a premiere-class lounge on a trans-Atlantic flight, minus the crying infants and the stale peanuts.

The walls were lined with dark velvet that seemed to suck the sound out of the air. A mahogany table sat between two plush leather seats, and on it rested a decanter of wine that shimmered with a pale, bioluminescent blue. Thaddeus Vane poured two glasses, the liquid flowing with a viscosity that suggested it was more mana than grapes.

"The journey to Aethelgard takes four hours by the Great Conduit," Vane said, his voice perfectly clear despite the carriage's incredible speed. He gestured at the wine, which pulsed in time with the carriage's hum. "In Oakhaven, that distance would take a week by horse. The Empire does not believe in wasting time on transit. Every saved hour is a gain in interest-bearing capital."

Victor leaned back, his own leather briefcase resting on his lap. He felt a slight vibration beneath his feet—a rhythmic, high-frequency hum that indicated they were no longer on a dirt road. It was the sound of concentrated power being funneled through specialized conductors, a sound Victor associated with the server rooms of his previous life.

"We’ve hitched onto the Imperial Mana-Rail," Vane explained, seeing Victor’s gaze drop to the floor. "A ley-line bridge maintained by the Bureau of Logistical Efficiency. It costs the Empire three thousand mana-shards an hour to operate, but it increases the movement of capital by four hundred percent. A worthy trade-off. We are currently traveling at a speed that would liquefy a standard carriage. The obsidian shell of this vehicle is the only thing keeping us in a state of physical continuity."

Victor looked out the window, where the landscape was a blur of grey and green, smeared like paint on a canvas. He could see the occasional flare of a relay station—massive, obsidian obelisks that pulsed with blue light as they passed. Between them, the air itself seemed to ripple with the tension of the conduit. 

"Centralization on this scale requires massive energy expenditure," Victor noted, his mind already calculating the maintenance costs of those obelisks. "But the data-latency must be near zero. You aren't just moving people, Vane. You're moving information."

"Precisely," Vane said, his eyes gleaming with professional appreciation. "Aethelgard knows what happens at the border within minutes of the event. We call it the 'Total Audit Atmosphere'. There is no corner of the Empire that isn't under some form of real-time fiscal surveillance."

Victor nodded, his mind already calculating the ROI of nationalized infrastructure. "Efficiency through centralization. I approve."

"Let’s talk about your first assignment, Mr. Kaine," Vane said, placing a small, multifaceted crystal on the table. It sat there, pulsing with a deep, authoritative violet light. "The Emperor does not hire auditors for the sake of counting coins. He hires us to excise rot."

He tapped the crystal. A holographic map of the northern territories bloomed in the air between them. It showed a jagged, mountainous region known as the Grey Spires.

"The Duchy of Valoria," Vane stated. "Once the primary source of the Empire's iron and silver. For the last three fiscal years, their production reports have remained perfectly flat—exactly on target, down to the last ounce."

Victor’s eyes narrowed. "That’s statistically impossible. Mining is subject to seasonal fluctuations, equipment failure, and labor strikes. A perfectly flat production line isn't a success; it's a cover-up."

Vane smiled, the expression thin and razor-sharp. "Precisely. Governor Malphas has been filing perfect reports while the actual shipments to the Capital have dropped by fifteen percent. He’s skimming the surplus, or he’s selling to the Southern Free Cities on a black market we haven't mapped yet."

"And you want me to find the leak," Victor said.

"I want you to do more than find it," Vane countered. "I want you to restructure the entire duchy. Malphas has turned Valoria into his personal piggy bank. He’s bloated the local bureaucracy, hired his cousins as inspectors, and established a series of 'Protection Levies' that are strangling the independent miners."

Vane leaned forward, the glow of the holographic map reflecting in his monocle.

"The Emperor is tired of Malphas. But he cannot simply execute a Duke of the Blood without evidence that wouldn't spark a civil war. He needs an Auditor. Someone with no ties to the nobility. Someone who sees a Duke not as a man of blood, but as a failing asset."

Victor looked at the map. The verticality of the Grey Spires looked like a nightmare for logistics, but a playground for hostile acquisition. 

"The five hundred thousand gold pieces mentioned earlier," Victor asked. "What are the limitations on its use?"

"The Imperial Budget is yours to deploy," Vane said, as if discussing the purchase of a loaf of bread. "Bribes, security contractors, alchemical reagents, or simply buying out the local banks to force a liquidity crisis. We do not care about your methods, Mr. Kaine. We only care about the year-end reconciliation."

Victor reached out and touched the crystal. The blue light of his ARMI interface merged with the violet of the Imperial data-net, creating a swirling vortex of information that flooded his vision.

"Acceptable," Victor said. "I’ll need a list of the local sub-contractors and the Governor’s current debt-to-equity ratio."

"Everything is in the crystal," Vane said, leaning back. "But be warned. You are not the only Auditor in the Empire. Senior Partner Hestia oversees the Western Grain Belt, and Senior Partner Thorne manages the Naval Shipyards. They have heard of your... insurance arbitrage. They will be watching to see if you are a rising star or a liability to be liquidated."

Victor adjusted his tie. He had dealt with rival partners before. Back on Earth, the vultures in the corner offices were far more dangerous than any dragon he had yet encountered. 

"I prefer to be watched," Victor stated. "It makes the eventual takeover so much more satisfying for the shareholders."

The carriage began to slow. The high-frequency hum shifted to a deep, resonant rumble, and the black velvet curtains on the windows pulled back automatically. 

Victor looked out. For a moment, even he—the man who had seen the skyscrapers of Chicago and the neon sprawls of Tokyo—felt a tremor of genuine awe.

Aethelgard did not sit on the ground. It sat on the world.

The city was built around a central spire of white stone and pulsating blue crystal that rose so high it pierced the cloud layer. Around this core, the city was arranged in ascending rings, each one a vertical masterpiece of architecture and magic. Massive waterfalls of liquid mana cascaded from the upper tiers, powering the lights of the lower districts in a shimmering curtain of electric blue.

Hovering platforms moved between the tiers like blood cells through an artery, carrying cargo and passengers. The scale of it was staggering—Oakhaven was a village compared to this. The Cathedral of Light, which had seemed so imposing just a week ago, would have fit comfortably into one of the Capital’s mid-tier warehouse districts.

"Welcome to the heart of the machine," Vane said, his voice carrying a note of quiet pride. "The Imperial Capital, Aethelgard. Population: Four million. GDP: Undisclosed."

Victor watched as the carriage descended toward a landing pad on the third tier—the administrative heart of the Empire. The air grew thicker with the scent of ozone and the rhythmic *thrum* of the floating platforms. He saw the massive banners of the Bureau of Imperial Audit snapping in the wind, each one bearing the silver eye that saw everything and forgave nothing.

As they touched down, the landing pad hissed with escaping steam. A group of gargoyles—made of the same obsidian as the carriage—detached themselves from the architecture and moved to secure the area. They didn't growl; they simply stood with their wings folded, their eyes glowing with a cold, blue compliance-light.

Victor stepped out of the carriage as the door hissed open. The air here was thin, cold, and tasted of ozone and expensive incense. Ahead of him, a row of clerks in grey suits bowed in perfect unison, their clipboards held like shields. 

Behind them, the entrance to the Bureau was a massive archway of white marble, inscribed with the Names of the Great Auditors. It wasn't a temple to a god; it was a cathedral of the Ledger. 

"Senior Partner Vane," the lead clerk said. "The High Council is expecting your report on the Oakhaven transition. And Senior Partner Hestia has already requested a copy of the new hire's psychological evaluation."

Vane gave a short, dismissive wave. "Hestia can wait until the first quarterly review. The report is sitting next to me."

Victor Kaine smoothed his suit jacket, his leather briefcase held firmly at his side. He noticed a clerk glancing at his Earth-style tie with a mixture of confusion and professional interest. To Victor, the clerk was just another unit of labor, but in this city, even the labor looked like it had been optimized for maximum aesthetic output.

"Take me to the office," Victor said, his voice carrying the authority of a man who had already begun his first audit of the city. "I have a duchy to liquidate. And I'd like a list of the available administrative support staff. I assume the Bureau provides entry-level analysts?"

"The best in the world, sir," the clerk replied, turning with a sharp heel-click.

The clerks turned as one, their footsteps echoing on the polished white stone of the landing pad. Victor walked among them, a dark, sharp-edged shadow in the heart of the Empire’s golden light. 

High above, the Senior Partners watched from their balconies, their monocles catching the sun. The Manager had arrived. And the Empire's books would never be the same again.
