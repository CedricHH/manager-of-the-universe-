# Chapter 54: The Selfless Act (Part 3)

**EARTH. THE PARKING GARAGE.**

2:47 AM.

Victor's car rolled to a stop on the third level of an underground parking structure. The engine ticked as it cooled. The dashboard lights faded to black. The silence was absolute — the particular silence of a building that didn't know it was about to become the site of a corporate apocalypse.

He sat behind the wheel for a long moment.

The thumb drive was warm in his jacket pocket. Sixteen gigabytes of career destruction. The folder of forty-seven faces rested on the passenger seat, its manila edges catching the dim glow of emergency lighting.

Victor considered turning around.

Not out of fear. He didn't feel fear — he'd established that during the drive. But he felt *awareness*. The cold, crystalline awareness that this moment was the last exit on the highway. Once he walked into this building, the calculation became irreversible. The evidence would leave his hands. It would become someone else's weapon.

Right now, he could still abort. Still drive home. Still choose the high-probability survival path.

The math was simple. 98% survival if he stayed silent. 15% if he delivered the evidence.

Victor opened the car door and stepped out.

He left the folder on the passenger seat for exactly three seconds — long enough to feel its weight disappear — then reached back and retrieved it. The faces came with him. They had earned that much.

The parking garage was empty except for one other vehicle: a sensible gray sedan, probably belonging to whoever had agreed to meet him at 3 AM. Lawyers who worked this late were either dedicated or desperate.

Victor was counting on both.

---

The elevator dinged softly on the eighth floor.

The hallway was dark. Industrial carpet. Fluorescent lights switched off for the night. At the far end, a thin sliver of light escaped from beneath a conference room door.

**HARTLEY, CHEN & ASSOCIATES**  
*Employment Litigation | Corporate Accountability*

Victor walked toward the light.

The conference room was small — a table for six, a whiteboard covered in case notes, a window overlooking the city's sleeping skyline. One woman sat at the head of the table, a laptop open before her, a cup of coffee that had long gone cold.

Sarah Chen. Mid-forties. Sharp eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses. The kind of face that had seen too many depositions and not enough victories. She'd left a senior partnership at Morrison & Sterling — ironic, that name — to start this firm. A 40% pay cut. An 80% reduction in case volume.

But the cases she took now *mattered*.

That's what the research had said, anyway. Victor had spent three weeks profiling her before making contact. He knew her conviction rate, her settlement patterns, her political donations. He knew she'd been reprimanded twice by the Bar Association for "overly aggressive discovery tactics."

She was perfect.

"You came," Chen said. Her voice was neutral, professional. The voice of someone who had learned not to trust anonymous whistleblowers until they actually showed up.

"I said I would."

Victor crossed to the table and placed the thumb drive beside her laptop. Then the folder. The forty-seven faces fanned slightly as the manila hit the wood.

"What am I looking at?" Chen asked.

"Everything." Victor pulled out a chair and sat. "Emails between the CEO and the board acknowledging the Congolese supply chain issues. Wire transfers to shell companies in Luxembourg that ultimately funded the operations. Quarterly reports where someone wrote 'acceptable risk' next to casualty projections. And correspondence with a Senator who made the initial investigation disappear."

Chen didn't touch the drive. She stared at it like it might bite.

"This is the Project Cobalt case."

"Yes."

"You were the executive they blamed."

"Yes."

"And now you're handing me evidence that proves the board knew everything." Chen's eyes finally lifted to meet his. "Why?"

Victor had prepared for this question. He'd rehearsed the answer in his head during the drive — something about justice, something about accountability, something about the forty-seven faces deserving recognition.

What came out was different.

"Because the math is wrong," he said. "I was supposed to approve supply chain optimizations. I was supposed to reduce costs. I did that. And forty-seven people died, and the company kept running, and they'll do it again." He paused. "The board has projects in Southeast Asia, Africa, South America. Same contractors. Same oversight gaps. Same quarterly pressure to cut corners."

"You're saying this wasn't an isolated incident."

"I'm saying that if nothing changes, I estimate two hundred additional casualties over the next decade. Conservative estimate."

Chen was quiet for a long moment.

"You understand this will destroy you too," she said finally. "Your signature is on half these documents. Even as a cooperating witness, you'll face criminal liability. Civil suits. The media will tear you apart."

Victor almost smiled. Almost.

"I'm already destroyed," he said. "I just haven't stopped moving yet."

---

The meeting lasted forty-seven minutes.

Victor walked Chen through the evidence chain — which documents corroborated which, where the authentication keys were hidden, how to verify the metadata that proved the files hadn't been altered. She asked sharp questions. He provided sharp answers. They fell into a rhythm that Victor recognized from countless boardroom negotiations — two professionals communicating in the language of evidence and implication.

By the end, she had stopped treating him like a potential asset and started treating him like a colleague. Someone who understood what it cost to walk into a room with a bomb in your pocket and hand it to a stranger.

It was almost pleasant. Almost professional. Almost like the last normal conversation Victor Kaine would ever have.

At 3:34 AM, there was nothing left to say.

"One more thing," Chen said as Victor stood to leave. "The people behind this — the Senator, the board's security consultants — they don't let witnesses survive. You know that."

"I know."

"And you came anyway."

"I did the math." Victor straightened his jacket. "Forty-eight hours until you leak the first documents. Seventy-two until the regulatory response begins. After that, eliminating me becomes counterproductive. The story is already out. Killing the source only confirms its validity."

Chen frowned. "That's a very narrow window."

"Twenty-nine hours, optimistically. Assuming your team moves at maximum efficiency."

"And before that window? Before the story goes public?"

Victor met her eyes. There was nothing in his expression — no fear, no bravado, no resigned acceptance. Just the calm arithmetic of a man who had solved an equation.

"Before that, I'm a liability that the board will want to liquidate. Their security consultants are professionals. They'll identify me as the leak within eighteen hours, maybe less. They'll respond accordingly."

"And you're okay with that?"

"Okay is a moral judgment. I've made the calculation. The calculation doesn't require me to be okay."

He paused at the door.

"Good luck, Ms. Chen. Make it count."

**PRESENT DAY — TERRA-INSOLVIA**

Victor stood alone in a dungeon corridor.

He didn't remember leaving the War Room. Didn't remember walking past Sniv's concerned questions or Asterion's watchful gaze. The memory had taken him completely — dragged him back to that parking garage, that conference room, that woman's sharp eyes.

He remembered walking to his car after the meeting. Remembered sitting behind the wheel. Remembered looking at the empty passenger seat where the folder used to be.

Forty-seven faces. Given away. Entrusted to someone else's war.

The question surfaced without permission: *Did it matter?*

The board went to prison — he knew that much. The Consortium's briefing files had included his Earth obituary. Project Cobalt became a textbook case in corporate ethics courses. The victims' families received settlements that couldn't bring anyone back but at least provided economic stability.

And Victor Kaine died in his apartment three days after the delivery. Heart attack, according to the coroner. Natural causes.

It wasn't natural. He remembered that now. He remembered everything except the final moment — the one he'd been avoiding since he woke up in this world.

> **[ARMI - MEMORY INTEGRATION]**  
> Segment Complete: The Delivery.  
> Remaining: The Death (Final Segment).  
> Integration Status: 84%.  
> Warning: Final memory contains termination event.  
> Recommendation: Complete integration before high-stress operations.  
> Note: Avoidance degrades psychological efficiency by ~15%.

Victor dismissed the notification.

He wasn't avoiding the memory. He was... prioritizing. There was a prince arriving in sixty-four hours. There were presentations to prepare. There were calculations to make.

The death could wait.

Except it couldn't. The memory was there, pressing against the edges of his consciousness, demanding to be processed. He could feel it — the final fragment, the missing piece, the moment when Victor Kaine stopped being an Earth executive and started becoming... whatever he was now.

"Tomorrow," he murmured to the empty corridor. "Tomorrow I remember how I died."

The dungeon's shadows didn't respond.

Victor turned and walked back toward the War Room.

There was work to do.
