# Chapter 51: The Crown Asset

The Adventurer Guild had made a critical error.

Victor stood in the Core Chamber, hands clasped behind his back, watching Nova project a shimmering display of data onto the cavern wall. Maps. Names. Trade routes. Debt ledgers.

They assumed he would wait for their petition. They assumed he would react rather than act.

They assumed wrong.

"Pull up everything we have on Crown Prince Aldric," Victor said. "And I mean everything. His tutors. His childhood friends. His preferred breakfast foods. I want to know this man better than his own mother does."

Nova pulsed. The crystalline light shifted, reforming into a portrait — a young man with sharp features and idealistic eyes. The kind of eyes that hadn't yet learned that idealism was just naivety with better marketing.

> **[ARMI - TARGET ANALYSIS]**  
> Subject: Crown Prince Aldric Valdris II  
> Age: 27 | Position: Heir Apparent, Kingdom of Valdris  
> **Threat Level**: Low (direct) | High (institutional)  
> **Opportunity Assessment**: Significant  
> Strategic Profile: Idealistic, ambitious, seeks father's approval.  
> Key Vulnerability: Believes the system works.

Sniv hunched over a stone table, his clipboard clutched like a holy relic. The goblin had spent three days gathering intelligence — bribing merchants, eavesdropping on tavern gossip, trading rations for rumors.

"Boss! Sniv has intel!" The goblin's voice was pitched with excitement. "Prince Aldric is... inspector? Like scary parchment-man from yesterday?"

"Not exactly." Victor turned from the projection. "The Crown Prince oversees the Eastern Revenue Commission. He audits the auditors. Checks if the tax collectors are skimming too much. He's the King's eyes and ears in territories like Eastmarch."

"So he is... boss-boss-boss of parchment-man?"

"In a manner of speaking."

Valerius paced behind them, his merchant robes stained with nervous sweat. The former Guild auditor looked like a man who had realized too late that he'd jumped from a sinking ship onto a burning one.

"This is insane," Valerius muttered. "You can't just... *target* the Crown Prince. He's royalty. Protected by a thousand laws and twice as many swords."

"I'm not targeting him." Victor didn't bother turning around. "I'm courting him. There's a difference."

"The difference is a beheading versus a beheading with extra steps!"

Victor smiled. It was not a warm smile.

"Tell me about the kingdom's finances, Valerius. What do you know about the royal treasury?"

The former auditor stopped pacing. His expression shifted — the particular shift of a man who had just realized he possessed dangerous knowledge.

"It's... I've heard rumors. Every merchant has." He lowered his voice. "The kingdom is bleeding gold. The border wars three years ago. The crop failures. The Church demanding tithes. King Aldric IV has been borrowing from the Merchant Conglomerates at usurious rates just to maintain the army."

"And the Crown Prince?"

"Doesn't know. Or didn't, last I heard. The King keeps the worst of it hidden from him." Valerius shook his head. "The Prince thinks the kingdom is stable. He thinks his inspections actually accomplish something. He's... well."

"Naive?"

"I was going to say 'tragically optimistic,' but yes."

Victor processed this. A prince who believed in the system. A kingdom that was secretly drowning in debt. A father who hid the truth from his own heir.

The optimization opportunities were *beautiful*.

> **[ARMI]**  
> Strategic Opportunity Identified: Information Asymmetry  
> Prince Aldric lacks accurate data on kingdom's fiscal position.  
> Victor possesses information the target needs but cannot obtain internally.  
> **Recommended Play**: Position as *solution provider*, not competitor.  
> Note: Educating a naive prince is easier than corrupting a cynical one.

"What's the Guild's timeline?" Victor asked. "When does Vorne file his petition?"

Valerius rubbed his face. "Two weeks. Maybe three. He needs to compile his findings, submit them through proper channels, get departmental sign-off. You know how bureaucracies work."

"I do." Victor smiled again. This time, it was almost genuine. "Which means we have two weeks to make ourselves too valuable to destroy."

"And how exactly—"

"By giving the Crown something they want more than they want compliance." Victor turned back to Nova's projection. "What's the Prince's itinerary for the next month?"

Nova flickered. New data scrolled across the cavern wall.

"ACCESSING MERCHANT GUILD TRADE REPORTS. CROSS-REFERENCING WITH ROYAL ANNOUNCEMENT SCHEDULES." The Core's synthesized voice echoed. "CROWN PRINCE ALDRIC IS SCHEDULED TO TOUR EASTMARCH IN APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN DAYS. ROUTINE REVENUE INSPECTION. EXPECTED DURATION: FIVE DAYS."

"Eighteen days." Victor calculated. "That's before the Guild petition arrives. If we can intercept him—"

A commotion echoed from the upper tunnels. Rapid footsteps. The scrabble of claws on stone.

Zip, Insolvia Holdings' kobold scout commander, burst through the chamber entrance. His scales were dusty from a hard run. His breath came in sharp gasps.

"Boss! BOSS!" The kobold's voice cracked. "Messenger! At forest edge! Royal seal! Not Guild — *Crown* seal!"

Victor went very still.

"A royal messenger," he repeated slowly. "Already?"

"Big human! Fancy horse! Zips saw the banner — lions and golden crown thing!" Zip's tail lashed with agitation. "Human asking for 'Lord of Insolvia Holdings.' By name! *Your* name!"

Valerius made a strangled sound. "That's impossible. The Prince's inspection isn't for another—"

"Show me."

---

They reached the observation post in minutes.

Victor crouched behind a rocky outcropping fifty meters from the tree line, watching through a gap in the undergrowth. Beside him, Zip pointed urgently toward the road.

The messenger was exactly as described. A royal courier in crimson and gold, mounted on a destrier that probably cost more than most peasants would earn in a decade. The horse stood with military stillness while its rider looked toward the dungeon entrance.

On the messenger's chest, clear even at this distance: the Crown Seal of Valdris.

"That's not an inspection notice," Victor murmured. "Inspection notices come through guild channels. This is a direct address."

"What does that mean?" Valerius whispered. He had insisted on accompanying them despite being clearly terrified.

"It means someone in the capital wants to talk. Privately." Victor studied the messenger's posture. Relaxed, but alert. Not a threat — a courier. "The question is why."

Nova's voice resonated in his mind through their administrator link. "I HAVE INTERCEPTED LOCAL INTELLIGENCE. THERE HAVE BEEN MERCHANT REPORTS ABOUT 'UNUSUAL DUNGEON ACTIVITY' REACHING THE CAPITAL. ADDITIONALLY, LORD STERLING'S COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE ROYAL COURT HAVE INCREASED THREE HUNDRED PERCENT IN THE PAST WEEK."

Sterling.

Victor felt a flicker of grudging respect. The nobleman was playing his own game — informing the Crown directly, trying to leverage Victor's presence before others could. Smart move. Potentially dangerous, depending on how the information was framed.

"How do you want to proceed, Boss?" Zip asked. "Zip can make messenger *go away*."

"No. We receive him." Victor straightened. "Properly."

"Properly?" Valerius looked aghast. "You're going to invite a *royal messenger* into a *dungeon full of monsters*?"

"Insolvia Holdings is a fully compliant business operation with all appropriate documentation on file." Victor adjusted his jacket. "And I'm about to make a very positive first impression."

He stepped out of cover and began walking toward the tree line.

The messenger's hand went to his sword. Then stopped.

Victor approached alone, unarmed, dressed in his standard attire — dark suit, precisely knotted tie, leather shoes polished to a mirror shine. He looked exactly like what he claimed to be: a businessman.

"Good morning," Victor said pleasantly. "I understand you're looking for me."

The courier was professional. He recovered quickly from his surprise, straightening in his saddle.

"Are you Victor Kaine? Lord of Insolvia Holdings?"

"I am."

"Then I bear a message from His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Aldric Valdris." The messenger produced a sealed scroll from his saddlebag. "The Prince requests your presence at Eastmarch Keep. He will arrive in three days to conduct a preliminary assessment of unusual economic activity in this territory."

Victor took the scroll. Broke the seal. Read.

> **[ARMI - URGENT UPDATE]**  
> Timeline Accelerated.  
> Previous Estimate: 18 days to Prince's arrival.  
> Actual Timeline: **72 hours.**  
> Analysis: Crown received information suggesting immediate investigation required.  
> Probability: Sterling's reports triggered emergency response.  
> **Status**: ADAPT OR FAIL.

Three days.

Not eighteen. *Three*.

"Will there be a response?" the messenger asked.

Victor folded the scroll carefully. His mind was already racing — recalculating schedules, reassessing assets, reformulating strategy. The Guild's petition would arrive after the Prince's inspection, not before. That changed everything.

If Victor handled this correctly, he wouldn't just survive the Guild's challenge.

He would acquire a prince.

"Yes," Victor said. "Tell His Royal Highness that Insolvia Holdings welcomes the Crown's inquiry. We have nothing to hide and everything to offer."

The messenger nodded, wheeled his horse, and departed.

Victor stood alone in the clearing, watching until the courier disappeared around a bend in the road. Then he turned and walked back toward the dungeon.

Valerius was waiting at the tree line, practically vibrating with anxiety.

"Well? What does it say? Are we dead?"

"Far from it." Victor handed him the scroll. "We have a new priority client arriving in seventy-two hours. I suggest we prepare a very impressive presentation."

> **[ARMI]**  
> Opportunity Window: 72 hours.  
> Objective: Position for Crown acquisition.  
> Risk Level: Extreme.  
> Potential Reward: Unlimited.  
> **Victor Kaine's Assessment**: Every regulator is just a stakeholder who hasn't seen the right numbers yet.

> **[ARMI - STRATEGIC MILESTONE]**
> Quest Complete: Crown Asset Secured
> EXP Awarded: +700 (High-Risk Acquisition)
> Total EXP: 8,785/8,750
> STATUS: **LEVEL UP** (6 → 7)
> Stat Points Allocated: +5 (INT+2, CHA+2, WIS+1)

He straightened his jacket.

"Let's make sure the Prince likes what he finds."
