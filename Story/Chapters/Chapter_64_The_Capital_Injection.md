# Chapter 64: The Capital Injection

The entrance to the Fourth Floor was a solid slab of obsidian, unmarked except for a single, glowing keyhole.

Victor stood before it, holding the "Capital Key." It wasn't made of metal; it was made of solid mana, crystallized from the 10,000 gold pieces he had just deposited into the Dungeon Core's treasury.

"Are you sure about this, Boss?" Valerius asked, clutching his ledger like a shield. "Once you turn that key, the interest clock starts ticking. 5% per annum, compounded monthly. If we don't generate revenue immediately..."

"Time is money, Valerius," Victor interrupted. "And right now, we are wasting both."

He jammed the key into the slot.

**[TRANSACTION APPROVED]**
**[FUNDS DEDUCTED: 10,000 GP]**
**[UNLOCKING FLOOR 4...]**

The obsidian slab didn't open; it dissolved.

A blast of stale, ancient air hit them.

Behind the door lay a void. A massive, empty cavern waiting for a biome.

"Alright," Victor clapped his hands. "Let's build a money printer. System, bring up the Biome Catalog."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Available Biomes**:
> 1. **The Fungal Depths** (Low Cost, Poison Damage).
> 2. **The Lava Pits** (High Cost, High Lethality).
> 3. **The Crystal Caverns** (Medium Cost, Magic Focus).
> 4. **The Jungle of Avarice** (High Variance, High Loot Tables).

"Option 4," Victor said instantly. "The Bank wants yield. That means we need drops. Rare drops. Jungles have the highest biodiversity, which means the widest loot tables."

**[CONFIRM: JUNGLE BIOME? COST: 5,000 GP]**

"Do it."

The cavern shuddered. Massive roots burst from the stone ceiling. Vines rapidly descended like green snakes. Trees grew from nothing, spiraling upwards in seconds. The air turned hot and humid. The sound of distant, synthetic monkeys filled the silence.

"It works," Sniv gasped, poking a giant fern. "It's sticky."

"It's profitable," Victor corrected. "Now, we need a Boss. Someone flashy. Someone who drops good gear but is farmable."

"Farmable?" Valerius asked.

"If he kills everyone, nobody gets loot, and the Bank gets zero yield. If he dies too easily, the loot loses value. We need... a showman."

Victor scrolled through the **Mercenary Monster Database**.

"Here. **Gorg, the Ape King**. Retired Heavy-Weight Champion of the Western Badlands. 2,000 GP signing bonus."

**The Hiring Interview**

Gorg materialized in the center of the jungle. A massive shape, a gorilla the size of a carriage, wearing gold-plated armor and holding a giant stone totem. He blinked, looking at the suddenly grown trees.

"Me Gorg?" the ape rumbled. Deep bass voice. Surprisingly articulate.

"Victor Kaine," Victor stepped forward, offering a hand (which Gorg ignored). "CEO of Insolvia. Welcome to the team. Let's talk compensation."

Gorg sat down, shaking the ground. "Gorg expensive. Gorg want fruit. Gorg want shiny."

"We can do fruit," Victor nodded to Valerius, who started taking notes. "Unlimited banana access. Plus a 10% performance bonus on all adventurer kills. And dental."

"Dental?" Gorg scratched his chin. "Gorg have tooth ache."

"We have a slime for that," Victor promised. "But I need performance. You need to be scary, but fair. No one-shot kills. Give them a show. Roar a lot. Throw trees... but miss by a few inches so they feel cool dodging it."

Gorg frowned. "Gorg hold back? Gorg creates illusion of danger?"

"Exactly. It's not a fight, Gorg. It's theater. You are the villain in their story. Make them feel like heroes... right up until they die or win."

Gorg grinned, revealing massive yellow teeth. "Gorg like theater. Gorg wanted to be actor. But world only see monster."

"Here, you can be a star," Victor said. "Sign here."

Gorg stamped his massive thumb on the contract.

"Perfect," Victor smiled. "Open the gates."

**The Stress Test**

The problem with a 4-floor dungeon is commute time.
Adventurers hate walking. By the time they cleared Floors 1-3, they were tired, out of potions, and their inventory was full of goblin trash. They wouldn't have the energy to farm Floor 4 efficiently.

"We need velocity," Victor muttered, watching the first group of adventurers trudge slowly through the slime pits of Floor 1.

"Teleporters?" Valerius suggested.

"Teleporters are high-magic. Roland will flag them as 'Unlicensed Portal Activity'. We need a loophole."

Victor walked to the entrance of Floor 1.

Sir Roland was there, standing like a statue.

"Good afternoon, Heretic," Roland said.

"Officer," Victor nodded. "I am installing a 'Rapid Transit Initiative'. Elevators. For... ADA compliance. We have disabled adventurers who can't handle the stairs."

Roland stared at him. "You care about the disabled?"

"I care about accessibility," Victor lied. "It's in the Charter. Section 4, Paragraph 2: 'Equal Access to Danger'."

Roland grunted. He couldn't argue with the Charter. "Proceed. But if a demon comes out of that shaft..."

"It's one-way," Victor promised. "Down only."

Roland didn't move. He pulled out a measuring tape.

"Safety inspection," the Paladin announced.

He measured the width of the slide. He measured the angle of descent. He tapped the stone with his hammer to test structural integrity.

"No handrails," Roland noted.

"It's a slide, not a staircase," Victor argued. "Hands inside the vehicle at all times."

"Slope exceeds 15 degrees," Roland muttered. "High velocity risk. Potential for collision."

"That's the point! It's an *Adventure* Slide!"

Roland stood up slowly. "I will allow it. But I am logging a citation for 'Reckless Acceleration Infrastructure'. If a citizen breaks a leg *before* reaching the combat zone, you are liable."

"Fair," Victor accepted. "Now, can we let the customers in?"

Victor installed the "Gravity Shoots" (basically polished stone slides). Adventurers could now bypass Floors 1-3 and slide directly to the Jungle.

"Who wants to slide to the Jungle?" Victor announced to the crowd. "Express lane to High-Level Loot! No waiting!"

A party of "Whales"—adventurers in shining, mismatched expensive armor—stepped forward. They were the target demographic: Rich, impatient, and looking for Epics.

"We'll take the slide!" the leader shouted.

**The Pre-Game**

The Whales—a party calling themselves "The Golden Company"—landed in the jungle with a splash of mud (and dignity). They stood up, brushing off their expensive cloaks.

"Positioning!" the leader, a warrior in Mithril plate, shouted. "Mage, backline! Cleric, buff us! Rogue, find the crit spot!"

They spent five minutes just applying buffs. Shield spells, strength potions, agility oils. They drank potions like they were at an open bar.

"My sword costs more than this entire dungeon," the Warrior boasted, unsheathing a blade that glowed with three different elements. "Let's skin this monkey."

Victor, watching from above, did the math. *Three potions at 50g each. One Scroll of Haste at 100g. If they wipe, that’s 250g of consumables wasted. I love Whales.*

***

**The First Yield**

Victor, Valerius, and Sniv watched from the Observation Deck (a hidden balcony overlooking the Boss Arena).

The Whales engaged Gorg.

It was a messy fight. The adventurers didn't use strategy; they used expensive scrolls and brute force. Gorg played his part perfectly, roaring, throwing trees, but telegraphing his big hits so they could dodge.

"Come on..." Valerius whispered. "Drop something good. Malcom is watching."

Gorg roared one last time and collapsed (faking a dramatic death rattle).

The loot light triggered.

**[LOOT GENERATED]**
**Item**: [The Banana of Wisdom]
**Rarity**: **EPIC**
**Description**: Permanently increases INT by +2. Consumable.
**Market Value**: 5,000 GP.

"YES!" Valerius cheered. "Jackpot!"

The lead adventurer grabbed the glowing golden banana. "It's beautiful..."

Somewhere in the city, an unseen ledger updated.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Loot Detected**: 5,000 GP Value.
> **Bank Share (20%)**: 1,000 GP.
> **Transferring Funds...**

A magical pigeon materialized out of thin air and landed on Victor's shoulder. It carried a small scroll.

*yield accepted. tranche 2 unlocked. - m.*

"We did it," Victor exhaled. "The model works. The more they kill, the more we pay down the loan."

They had spent 7,000 GP (Biome + Boss) but generated 1,000 GP for the bank in a single fight. If they could run ten groups a day...

"Boss?"

It wasn't Valerius. It was Nova. The Core's voice echoed in Victor's head.

"I didn't spawn the mosquitoes."

Victor froze. "What?"

"The Jungle," Nova said. "There are mosquitoes. Big ones. Gold ones."

Victor looked down at the arena. The adventurers were celebrating. But buzzing around the edges of the clearing were insects. They shimmered with a metallic light.

They weren't attacking the adventurers. They were landing on the mana-rich trees. And sucking.

"They are eating the mana," Nova whispered. "They taste like... coins."

Victor's blood ran cold.

The loan. The magic key.

The Bank hadn't just given him money. They had embedded a tracking spell. A *living* tracking spell.

"A financial parasite," Victor realized. "Literally."

The mosquitoes weren't just monitoring the yield. They were *skimming* it. Every bit of mana they ate was a fraction of a percent of interest, being physically extracted from the dungeon's ecosystem.

"Valerius," Victor said sharply. "Get the fly swatter."

"The big one?"

"The *enchanted* one."

**Status**: The Dungeon is profitable. But the Bank has bugs.
