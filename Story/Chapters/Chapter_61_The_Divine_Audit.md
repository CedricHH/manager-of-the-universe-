# Chapter 61: The Divine Audit

The door to the Core Room didn't open. It didn't shatter. It simply ceased to exist.

One moment, there was a reinforced iron bulkhead, secured by five layers of goblin-forged locks and a Shadow-Seal.
The next moment, there was a rectangle of blinding white light, and the door was gone. Not dust. Not slag. *Gone*.

High Priestess Aurelia lowered her staff. The tip was smoking, smelling of ozone and ozone-burned iron.

"Behold," she whispered, her voice carrying over the ringing in Victor's ears. "The heart of the cancer."

She stepped through the smoking frame.

Victor scrambled after her, his mind racing through outcomes.
*Combat? No. She’s Level 35. She just deleted a ton of iron with a gesture. If I attack, I die.*
*Trap? The Core Room has no traps. It’s the engine room.*
*Leverage? I have one card left.*

He looked back at Prince Aldric. The Royal VIP was dusting flecks of nonexistent door off his velvet sleeve, looking annoyed rather than awed.

"A bit dramatic, Aurelia," Aldric muttered. "I believe that was private property."

"It is a crime scene," Aurelia retorted without looking back.

**The Core Room**

The chamber was circular, carved from the living rock of the mountain. In the center, suspended above a pit of endless shadow, floated **Nova**.

The Dungeon Core was beautiful—a dodecahedron of obsidian and amethyst, pulsing with a deep, rhythmic thrum. *THUM-thum. THUM-thum.*
Runes of management and structure floated around it like planetary rings.

But to Aurelia, it was a spider in the center of a web.

"A World Core," Aurelia said. Her voice trembled with a mix of fear and hatred. "Unshackled. Unbound. Forbidden by the First Edict."

She raised her staff. The light returned, brighter this time. A miniature sun began to form at the tip.

"I am saving the world from a parasite," she declared. "Prepare for purification."

The air in the room grew hot. The shadows hissed and retreated. Nova spun faster, glowing with a panicked red light.

Victor didn't run. He walked past the Prince and stepped directly into the line of fire.

He didn't draw a weapon. He didn't cast a spell.
He pulled out his notebook.

"Stop," Victor said. His voice wasn't loud, but it was steady.

Aurelia paused. The sun-fire reflected in her cold blue eyes.

"Move, Merchant. Or burn with your idol."

"You are about to destroy critical infrastructure," Victor said, tapping the notebook with his pen. "I assume you have prepared the compensation package?"

"Compensation?" Aurelia laughed. It was a terrifying sound. "I am cleansing Heresy! There is no price for the soul of the world!"

"There is a price for everything," Victor said. He turned to the Prince.

"Your Highness."

Aldric looked up from his sleeve. "Yes?"

"The asset you just agreed to charter," Victor pointed to the pulsing crystal behind him. "That is the engine. It generates the mana. It spawns the slimes. It mints the gold."

Aldric’s eyes narrowed.

"If she breaks it," Victor continued, "the production line stops. The tax revenue stops. The 15% kickback... vanishes. Forever."

Victor let the silence hang for a second.

"That Core is worth five thousand gold pieces a month. To the Crown."

Aldric looked at the Core. Then he looked at the Priestess. Then he looked at the massive ball of holy fire that was about to incinerate his new revenue stream.

The Prince sighed. He stepped forward, placing himself between Aurelia and Victor.

"High Priestess," Aldric said. His voice was bored no longer. It was the voice of the future King. "Stand down."

Aurelia’s eyes widened. "Your Highness? You defend *this*? It is a World Core! It consumes reality to grow! It is the enemy of the Gods!"

"It is a Royal Asset," Aldric corrected coldly. "Mr. Kaine and I have just concluded a verbal contract. This facility operates under a Provisional Charter of the Crown."

"A Charter cannot supersede the Faith!" Aurelia screamed. The sun-fire flared, hot enough to singe the ends of Victor's hair. "This is Treason against the Light!"

"And destroying Crown Property is Treason against the State," Aldric snapped. "Lower your staff, Aurelia. Or I will have the Royal Guard remove you."

The three Royal Guards at the tunnel entrance shifted uneasily. They didn't want to fight a High Priestess. But they *really* didn't want to disobey a Prince. Hands drifted to sword hilts.

Aurelia looked at the Prince. She saw the greed in his eyes. She saw the corruption.
Then she looked at Victor. She saw... nothing. Just a calculator in a human suit.

She held the spell for one heartbeat. Two.
Victor waited to be vaporized.

Then, with a scream of frustration, Aurelia slammed her staff into the stone floor.
*CRACK.*

The sun-fire dissipated in a wave of heat that blew Victor's tie over his shoulder.
The floor beneath her staff fractured, a spiderweb of cracks spreading toward the pit.

"You have doomed us," Aurelia whispered. "You have sold the kingdom for gold."

"We call it 'Economic Stimulus'," Aldric said, smoothing his hair. "Now, shall we return to the surface? All this holiness is making me thirsty."

**The Departure**

Ten minutes later, the Royal Carriage was ready to depart.
The lobby had been mostly restored, though the smell of ozone lingered.

Aldric leaned out of the carriage window. He held a scroll—the hastily drafted Charter, signed in Victor's office.

"I expect the first payment on the first of the month," Aldric said cheerfully. "Don't disappoint me, Mr. Kaine. My protection is expensive."

"You will have your ROI, Your Highness," Victor bowed.

Aldric tapped the side of the carriage. "Drive."

The carriage rolled away.

But Aurelia did not get in.

She stood by the gate, her white robes stark against the dark stone of the dungeon entrance. She watched the carriage leave, then turned back to Victor.

She walked up to him. Close. He could smell incense and cold ash.

"You won the battle," Aurelia said softly. "You played the boy's greed like a harp."

"I merely aligned interests," Victor said, meeting her gaze.

"The Prince protects you today," she continued. "But he is mortal. And he is fickle. One day, he will be late. Or he will want more than you can pay. Or he will simply forget."

She leaned in.

"And I will be waiting."

She raised a hand. A beam of light shot into the sky, creating a permanent, glowing sigil above the dungeon entrance.

**[MARK OF THE WATCHER]**

"A Paladin of the Eternal Light will be stationed here," Aurelia announced. "Effective immediately. He will not enter. He will not interfere with your... business. But he will watch. Every person who enters. Every movement. If you slip... if one drop of corruption spills out of this hole..."

She didn't finish the sentence. She didn't have to.

She turned and began the long walk down the mountain path, alone.

Victor watched her go. His hands were shaking. Just a little.

"Boss?" Sniv tugged at his pants. "The Scary Lady marked our door. Is that bad?"

"It's not good, Sniv," Victor admitted. "It means we have a compliance officer who can call down an orbital strike."

Asterion stepped up, his axe resting on his shoulder. "She is dangerous. She saw the Core."

"She did," Victor nodded. "The secret is out. We aren't hiding anymore."

Victor looked up at the glowing sigil in the sky. Then he looked at the signed Charter in his hand.
He had a Royal License. And a Divine Death Mark.

"Well," Victor straightened his tie. "Welcome to the big leagues."
