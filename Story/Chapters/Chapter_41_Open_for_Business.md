# Chapter 41: Open for Business

The morning sun over Oakhaven didn’t just illuminate the city; it audited the damage.

Smoke still drifted lazily from the charred Sector 4-C. Three market stalls were nothing but ash and twisted metal. It smelled of sulfur, burnt wood, and—to Victor’s experienced nose—opportunity.

Most merchants would see this as a disaster zone. Victor saw it as prime real estate with temporarily reduced rent.

"Setup complete, Boss!" Zip chirped.

The kobold wore a clean tunic with a small brass nametag: *Zip — Logistics Associate*. He was currently vibrating with anxiety, his eyes darting toward the angry crowd gathering at the perimeter of the burnt area.

"Excellent," Victor said. He adjusted the display on their makeshift counter—a sturdy oak table salvaged from the wreckage and draped in a pristine white cloth. "Position the inventory. Pyramid stack. Eye level."

> **[ARMI - MARKET ANALYSIS]**

> Opportunity Factor: CRITICAL

Kael stood to Victor’s left, hand resting casually on the pommel of his sword. Mira stood to the right, her eyes glowing faintly with detection magic. They looked professional. Dangerous. Expensive.

Exactly the branding Victor needed.

The crowd was murmuring. Pointing.

"That's him," a woman whispered. "The one who fought the Cartel."

"Is he crazy?" a man replied. "Setting up right where the fire was?"

Victor stepped forward. He didn't shout. He projected.

"The Alchemist Cartel says there is a shortage," Victor announced. His voice cut through the ambient noise like a quarterly earnings report dropping bad news. "They say prices must rise to fifteen gold pieces to cover 'supply chain difficulties.'"

He gestured to the smoking ruin behind him.

"This is their difficulty. They burn their competition."

The crowd quieted.

Victor picked up a vial. Red liquid swirled inside—standard health potion, but refined. Clearer. Better.

"My supply chain is fireproof," Victor said. "Standard Health Potion. Five Gold Pieces."

Silence.

Then, chaos.

"Five?"

"Did he say five?"

"I'll take three!"

The dam broke. The crowd surged forward, coins flashing in the morning light.

> **[ARMI - TRANSACTION LOG]**
> Sale: 3x Health Potion > +15 GP
> Sale: 5x Health Potion > +25 GP
> Sale: 1x Health Potion > +5 GP
> …
> Rate of Revenue: 150 GP/hour

"One at a time!" Zip squeaked, processing coins faster than a bank teller on stimulants. "Please form an orderly queue! Efficiency benefits everyone!"

Victor watched the metrics climb. It wasn't just about the gold. Every sale was a vote of no confidence in the Cartel. Every satisfied customer was a walking advertisement for the new market disruptor.

A heavyset man in fine velvet pushed his way to the front. A merchant captain, judging by the calluses and the entourage.

"I'll take everything you have," the man shouted. "Fifty crates. I have a caravan leaving for Valdris at noon."

The crowd shouted in protest, but the man slapped a heavy bag of gold onto the table. "I'm payin' cash!"

Victor raised a hand. The crowd quieted, waiting to see if he'd sell them out for a bulk buyer.

"I appreciate the liquidity," Victor said smoothly. "But liquidating my entire stock to a single wholesale buyer disrupts my B2C—Business to Customer—strategy. These people need potions."

The crowd cheered.

"However," Victor continued, leaning in. "I can offer you a B2B solution."

The merchant blinked. "B-to-what?"

"Business to Business," Victor said. He pulled a scroll from his belt. "The 'Platinum Supply Retainer'. You don't buy spot inventory. You sign a recurring contract. I guarantee you fifty crates a month at 4.5 Gold Pieces per unit—ten percent below my retail price—and you get priority fulfillment at my warehouse. No waiting in line."

The merchant's eyes widened. "Guaranteed supply? Below retail?"

"Consistent volume for me. Stability for you." Victor uncapped a pen. "Sign here. First shipment available tomorrow."

The merchant signed so fast he almost tore the parchment.

> **[ARMI - CONTRACT BOUND]**
> New Partner: Vorin Trade Caravans
> Value: 2,250 GP / Month
> Status: RECURRING REVENUE SECURED

Victor smiled. He hadn't just made a sale; he'd secured a subscription.

Then the inevitable bureaucratic friction arrived.

"Halt!"

The voice was nasal, authoritative, and incredibly annoying. A man in city official robes pushed through the crowd, followed by two bored-looking guards. He held a clipboard like a weapon.

"This area is a designated hazard zone," the official announced, tapping his clipboard. "Section 7, Paragraph 4 of the City Safety Code. No commercial activity allowed within fifty feet of a structural fire investigation."

The crowd groaned.

Victor didn't blink. He’d handled OSHA inspectors, tax auditors, and federal regulators on Earth. This man was an amateur.

"Name?" Victor asked.

The official blinked. "Inspector Vane. And I am shutting you down."

"Inspector Vane," Victor repeated. "Are you aware that this stall is operating under a provisional emergency permit issued by the Merchant Guild Council?"

Victor produced the document. He didn't hand it over; he held it up. The Guild seal—enchanted to shimmer with mana—was unmistakable.

"The Merchant Guild has jurisdiction over market recovery operations," Victor stated. "According to Council Bylaw 12-B, emergency commerce takes precedence over routine hazard assessments unless there is an active threat to life."

Vane stared at the seal. The color drained from his face. Challenging a street vendor was easy. Challenging the Council was career suicide.

"I... the investigation is ongoing," Vane stammered. "The structural integrity..."

"Is fine," Victor interrupted. "The table is solid. The ground is stable. Unless you are suggesting the Merchant Guild issued a permit for an unsafe location? That would be a serious accusation against Councilor Blackwood."

Drop the name. Watch the reaction.

Vane flinched. "No. Of course not."

"Then we are in compliance," Victor said. "Zip, next customer."

Vane retreated, but the look he cast over his shoulder wasn't just defeated. It was malicious.

Victor tapped his earpiece—a mana-crystal communication link. "Kael. Mira. Trouble incoming."

"I see them," Mira murmured. "Five men. North side. No uniforms, but they're moving in formation. Weapons concealed."

"Thugs?" Kael asked.

"Assets," Victor corrected. "Cartel enforcement assets. They realized the legal channel failed. Now they try the physical one."

The five men pushed through the line. Rough types. Leather armor under cloaks. The leader, a man with a broken nose and bad teeth, kicked the leg of the table.

Inventory wobbled.

"You're paying a toll," the leader growled. "Protection money. Lot of fires lately. Wouldn't want another accident."

The crowd went silent again. This was the reality they knew. The Cartel's shadow.

Victor sighed. "I admire the consistency. Extortion is a classic revenue model. But your timing is terrible."

> **[ARMI - THREAT ASSESSMENT]**
> Hostiles: 5
> Average Level: 8-10
> Threat Level: LOW
> Recommended Action: Liquidate

"We don't want trouble," the leader sneered. "Just the gold. And the stock."

Kael stepped forward. He didn't draw his sword. He didn't need to. The sheer presence of a Level 12 warrior who had cleared dungeon floors for a living was palpable.

"This stall protects Guild property," Kael said calmly. "And Guild personnel."

"I don't see no Guild badge," the leader spat. He reached for his dagger.

Mistake.

"Hostile negotiation initiated," Victor said.

Mira snapped her fingers.

A pulse of force magic—*Shockwave*—erupted from her hand. It wasn't lethal, but it was directional. The five thugs were lifted off their feet and thrown backward into the ash-covered debris of the burnt stalls.

They landed in a heap of coughing, groaning misery.

Kael was on them instantly, sword point hovering inches from the leader's throat.

"You attacked a Merchant Guild contractor," Kael announced to the square. "That is a felony. And a breach of the Peace."

Zip leaned over the counter. "Also, you knocked over a display! That is merchandise damage!"

Victor turned to the crowd. He raised his voice.

"The Cartel sends fire implies," he said. "They send thugs to steal your gold. I send you affordable healthcare."

He pointed to the pile of groaning enforcers. "City Guards! Please collect this refuse. I believe they have information about yesterday's arson."

The guards who had accompanied Inspector Vane looked at their superior. Vane was nowhere to be seen. They looked at Kael's sword. They looked at the angry crowd.

They made the smart career choice.

"Right," one guard said, pulling out manacles. "You lot. Up."

The crowd cheered. It was a raw, cathartic sound. For years, they had paid the Cartel's prices and feared the Cartel's thugs. Today, they saw the thugs in the mud and the prices slashed by sixty percent.

Victor sold out his entire stock in forty minutes.

> **[ARMI - DAILY REPORT]**
> Total Revenue: +1,000 GP
> Expenses (COGS + Labor): -450 GP
> Net Profit: +550 GP
> ROI: Positive
> Market Share: 2% (Gained)

Zip was practically vibrating with joy as he packed up the empty crates. "Best day ever, Boss! Did you see the coins? The shiny coins!"

"Good work, Zip," Victor said. "Inventory management was adequate."

"Adequate!" Zip beamed. High praise.

Kael wiped a speck of ash from his pauldron. "That was... easier than expected. They sent amateurs."

"They sent expendables," Victor said. "To test our defenses. Now they know."

"Know what?" Mira asked.

"That we are not a small business," Victor said. "We are a hostile takeover."

A shadow fell over the table.

Victor looked up. It wasn't a thug. It was a man in a pristine black suit—tailored silk, gold cufflinks. A servant, but one of high standing.

He held out a black envelope with gold lettering.

"Mr. Kaine," the servant said. His voice was polite, deferential, and cold as ice. "A message from Guildmaster Groll."

Victor took the envelope. He didn't open it. He scanned it.

> **[ARMI - ITEM SCAN]**
> Item: Invitation to the Spire
> Properties: Magical Trace (Location Tracking), Intimidation Aura (Low)
> Origin: Alchemist Guild Headquarters

"The Guildmaster requests your presence," the servant said. "Tonight. For dinner."

"Is that a request?" Victor asked. "Or a summons?"

The servant smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. "The Guildmaster is eager to discuss... market synergies."

"Tell him I accept," Victor said. "I never turn down a business meeting."

The servant bowed and vanished into the crowd.

Kael frowned. "The Spire? That's their fortress, Victor. If you go in there..."

"It's a trap," Mira finished. "Obviously."

"Of course it's a trap," Victor said. He pocketed the invitation. "But it's also where the board of directors sits."

He looked at the burnt ruin of the market square.

"I've disrupted their low-level operations. Now it's time to meet the CEO."

Victor adjusted his cuffs.

"Let's go home. I need to prepare my presentation."
