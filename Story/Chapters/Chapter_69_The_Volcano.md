# Chapter 69: The Volcano

The morning after the Merchant's Guild deal, Victor stood before the sealed gateway to Floor 5.

It was different from the others.

The previous floors had simple stone archways—utilitarian, functional. Floor 5's entrance was **obsidian**. Black volcanic glass, shot through with veins that glowed dull red, like coals in a dying fire. Heat radiated from the surface. Even standing ten feet away, Victor could feel sweat beginning to form.

Valerius stood beside him, nervously chew

ing on a quill.

"Are we sure about this, Boss?"

Victor pulled up the budget analysis.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Floor 5: Volcanic Biome**
> **Estimated Cost**: 8,000 GP minimum
> **Available Capital**: 15,000 GP
> **Remaining Buffer**: 7,000 GP
> **Capital Reserve Ratio**: 46.7% (below recommended 50%)
> **Risk Assessment**: ELEVATED

"We're sure," Victor said.

Nova's voice echoed in his mind. "Floor 5 is expensive, Administrator. Volcanic biomes require constant temperature regulation, fireproofing enchantments, and specialized monster contracts. Minimum viable investment: 8,000 GP. Are you certain?"

"Yes."

"Authorizing purchase."

The obsidian door shimmered, then dissolved like smoke.

Behind it: **Hell**.

***

**The Biome**

The cavern was massive—easily three times the size of Floor 4's jungle.

Rivers of molten lava flowed through channels carved into black stone. Obsidian pillars rose from the floor like jagged teeth. Massive crystals jutted from the walls, glowing faintly orange from internal heat. Sulfur vents hissed steam, and the air shimmered with thermal distortion.

It was beautiful.

And terrifying.

"Temperature regulation active," Nova reported. "Ambient heat capped at 45°C near safe zones, scaling to 80°C+ near lava flows. Adventurers will require fire resistance equipment or potions. This is end-game content."

Victor smiled. "Perfect. High barrier to entry means only serious parties will attempt it. And serious parties bring serious money."

Valerius wiped sweat from his forehead. "Boss, I can barely breathe, and we're only at the entrance."

"That's the point," Victor said.

They explored deeper.

The biome was stunning:
- Lava waterfalls cascading from upper ledges
- Obsidian bridges spanning molten rivers
- Fire crystals embedded in walls (valuable crafting material—50 GP each)
- Sul

fur vents creating natural hazards
- A central arena area with a raised platform—perfect for a boss fight

But it was **empty**. No monsters. No encounters. Just raw, dangerous terrain.

"We need to fill it," Victor said.

Nova materialized beside him—her ethereal form flickering in the heat shimmer. "I have monster options prepared. Four tiers."

She projected holographic images:

**Option A: Fire Elementals** - 2,000 GP
- Dangerous, thematic, drop valuable fire cores
- Risk: Difficult to control, may damage infrastructure

**Option B: Salamanders** - 1,500 GP
- Intelligent, trainable, good loot drops
- Risk: Expensive to maintain (require live prey for feeding)

**Option C: Magma Golems** - 3,000 GP
- Durable, predictable, low maintenance
- Risk: Slow-moving (boring fights, fewer repeat customers)

**Option D: Hire a Boss Monster Directly** - Variable cost
- Unique, theatrical, high personality
- Risk: Negotiation required, unpredictable costs

Victor analyzed each option.

> **[ARMI]**
> **Monster Economics Matrix**:
>
> **Fire Elementals**:
> - ROI: 140% over 18 months
> - Infrastructure damage risk: 10% revenue loss per incident
> - Appeal: High (thematic)
>
> **Salamanders**:
> - ROI: 180% over 18 months (BEST if managed properly)
> - Feeding cost: 200 GP/month
> - Appeal: Moderate (intelligent enemies = better fights)
>
> **Magma Golems**:
> - ROI: 110% over 18 months
> - Maintenance: Minimal
> - Appeal: Low (predictable = boring)
>
> **Boss Hire**:
> - ROI: 300%+ (if popular)
> - Risk: HIGH variability
> - Appeal: MAXIMUM (unique spectacle = premium pricing)

Victor made his decision.

"I want a Boss. Someone who can make this floor *legendary*. Theater matters as much as mechanics."

Nova tilted her head. "I know someone. But... you won't like them."

"Why not?"

"They're a dragon."

Valerius's ledger hit the floor.

Victor didn't blink. "How much?"

"5,000 GP signing bonus. 100 GP monthly salary. Plus 20% of any loot they personally drop."

> **[ARMI]**
> **Dragon Cost Analysis**:
> - Signing Bonus: 5,000 GP
> - Remaining Capital After: 2,000 GP
> - **WARNING**: Capital reserves at 13.3% (CRITICAL threshold)
> - Monthly Salary: 100 GP
> - Expected Marketing Value: +40% adventurer draw (dragon prestige effect)
> - Break-Even Timeline: 8 weeks (if Floor 5 performs to projection)

The numbers were tight.

Very tight.

But a **dragon** as Floor Boss?

That was the kind of spectacle that built reputations. Adventurers would travel from other cities just to attempt it.

"Summon them," Victor said.

***

**The Dragon Interview**

Nova opened a summoning circle—lines of blue fire tracing ancient runes onto the obsidian floor.

The air warped.

Then, in a burst of flame and sulfur, a dragon materialized.

Her name, according to the contract, was **Ignatia, the Ember Tyrant**.

She preferred "Iggy."

Victor had expected something massive—ancient, towering, voice like thunder. But Iggy was a **young adult dragon**, roughly the size of a large carriage. Sleek red scales, golden eyes, sharp horns, and wings folded against her back. She radiated heat like a furnace.

She looked at Victor.

Then sneered.

"You're the human who wants to *employ* me?"

"Victor Kaine. Yes."

"I don't work for humans."

"I'm not asking you to work *for* me," Victor said calmly. "I'm offering you a partnership. You get territory, a salary, and creative control over your domain."

Iggy narrowed her eyes. "What's the catch?"

"You don't kill adventurers outright. You give them a *chance* to win. Make fights theatrical. Epic. The kind of battle they'll tell stories about in taverns for years."

"You want me to... *perform?*" Her voice dripped with disdain.

"I want you to be a **legend**," Victor corrected. "Legends don't slaughter weaklings—they *test heroes*. And heroes pay premium rates for the privilege."

Iggy paused.

"What's my territory?"

"The entire fifth floor. You design your lair however you want. Lava throne, treasure hoard, dramatic arena. Full aesthetic control."

"...Hoard?"

Victor pulled out a contract. "I'll seed your hoard with 500 GP in gems and enchanted items initially. You keep 20% of your personal loot drops, which you can add to the hoard over time."

Iggy's golden eyes gleamed.

Dragons and hoards. Evolutionary fixation.

"And if I get bored?" she asked carefully.

"Then we renegotiate. But I think you'll find this more stimulating than sleeping in a cave for three centuries."

A long silence.

Iggy circled Victor once, sizing him up.

"Salary in gemstones," she said finally. "Not gold."

"Acceptable."

"And I want veto rights on my lair décor."

"Granted."

"And adventurers must *bow* before entering my chamber."

Victor considered. That was... actually good marketing.

"Agreed. I'll add a pressure plate at the door. Forces a bow or the entrance doesn't open."

Iggy smiled—rows of sharp teeth.

"Deal."

Victor extended his hand.

Iggy placed one claw gently on his palm.

The contract flared gold, binding magically.

***

**The Budget Reality**

Two hours later, Floor 5 was partially operational.

Iggy had claimed the central arena, arranging a "hoard" (mostly polished glass and cheap gemstones—Victor hadn't told her yet that they were fake). She seemed happy.

Valerius, however, was not.

He sat in Victor's office, staring at the updated budget.

> **Current Financial Position**:
> - Liquid Capital: **2,000 GP**
> - Outstanding Debt: 24,500 GP
> - Monthly Costs:
>   - Debt Service: 800 GP
>   - Iggy's Salary: 100 GP (in gemstones)
>   - Floor 5 Maintenance: 200 GP
>   - **Total**: 1,100 GP/month
> - Monthly Revenue (Floors 1-4): 2,400 GP
> - **Net Income**: +1,300 GP/month (before Floor 5 revenue)

"We're running on fumes, Boss," Valerius whispered. "If Floor 5 doesn't generate revenue in three weeks, we won't have enough capital to cover emergencies."

"Then Floor 5 will generate revenue in three weeks," Victor said.

"What if it doesn't?"

Victor pulled up a private calculation:

> **[ARMI]**
> **Scenario Planning**:
>
> **Best Case** (Floor 5 performs to projection):
> - Break-even: Week 3
> - Profitability: Week 8
> - ROI: 300% over 18 months
>
> **Base Case** (Floor 5 performs at 80% projection):
> - Break-even: Week 5
> - Profitability: Week 10
> - ROI: 220% over 18 months
>
> **Worst Case** (Floor 5 fails to attract customers):
> - Capital depletion: Week 6
> - Debt default risk: Week 8
> - Bankruptcy: Week 10

He closed the interface without sharing it with Valerius.

"It will work," Victor said.

"How do you know?"

"Because I designed it to."

Valerius didn't look convinced.

Victor stood, walking to the window. Down in the jungle, Gorg was practicing his roar. On Floor 3, Asterion was training with adventurers. Floor 2's slimes jiggled contentedly.

Everything was running smoothly.

But Floor 5 was different.

It wasn't just another floor.

It was a **bet**.

8,000 GP. A dragon. End-game difficulty.

If it succeeded, Dungeon Insolvia would become a destination, not just a local operation.

If it failed...

Victor pushed the thought away.

"Floor 5 opens in three days," he said. "Spread the word. Premium content. Dragon boss. Fire enchantments and rare gems. Minimum party level: 15."

"Three days?" Valerius yelped. "We haven't even stress-tested it!"

"Then we stress-test it tomorrow."

"With who?"

Victor smiled.

"The Crimson Blades owe me a favor."

***

Down in Floor 5, Ignatia arranged her fake gemstones into aesthetically pleasing piles.

She was already planning her dramatic entrance speech.

And in the Gilded Ledger, Director Malcom read a spy report:

> **INTEL: Dungeon Insolvia**
> **Update**: Floor 5 (Volcanic) operational
> **Cost**: Estimated 8,000 GP+
> **Boss**: Dragon (unconfirmed species)
> **Capital Reserves**: CRITICALLY LOW
> **Assessment**: Kaine overextended. High bankruptcy risk within 60 days.

Malcom smiled.

"Let him dig his own grave."

---

**STATUS**: Floor 5 operational. Dragon boss (Ignatia) hired. Capital reserves critical (2,000 GP). Stress test scheduled. Three days to launch. Margin for error: zero.
