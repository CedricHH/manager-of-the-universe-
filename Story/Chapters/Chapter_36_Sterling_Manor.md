# Chapter 36: Sterling Manor

Sterling Manor announced itself long before Victor reached the gates.

The estate sprawled across a hillside like a corporation that had peaked twenty years ago and been coasting on reputation since. Impressive architecture—stone construction, defensive towers that suggested military heritage, manicured grounds that required staff Victor's ARMI immediately flagged as "inefficient labor allocation."

But the details told the real story.

Professional guards—well-maintained equipment, disciplined posture, but Victor's eye caught the economics: dated uniforms, quality weapons with no recent upgrades, maintained fortifications but zero expansion.

> **[ARMI - ASSET ASSESSMENT: STERLING MANOR]**
> Property Value: High (est. 50,000+ GP)
> Liquid Capital: Low (maintenance-focused spending pattern)
> Staff Efficiency: 67% (overstaffed relative to modern operations)
> Assessment: Capital rich, cash poor
> Conclusion: Classic noble resource misallocation

Victor filed this away with particular satisfaction.

Lord Sterling ran his territory exactly like the hedge fund CEOs Victor had dismantled on Earth—high visible assets, low operational efficiency, vulnerable to anyone who understood the difference between wealth and cash flow.

The enforcers escorted him through gates that would have impressed merchants but made Victor calculate siege logistics. Past gardens that demonstrated horticultural investment Victor would have redirected to revenue-generating infrastructure. Into a receiving hall designed to project power through expensive irrelevant ornamentation.

"Wait here," the lead enforcer instructed. "Lord Sterling will see you shortly."

Translation: deliberate power play. Make the merchant understand his place.

Victor sat without complaint. Time was information. The longer he waited, the more he observed.

---

The receiving room was a masterclass in strategic deception.

Expensive furniture—aging but quality. Portraits of Sterling ancestors in military regalia. Account ledgers stacked on the desk, angled for a waiting guest to glimpse toll revenue figures and licensing fees—the kind of performance review designed for investors, not auditors.

Victor didn't touch them. Didn't need to.

But Victor read the subtext.

No expansion projects. No capital investments. No new revenue streams. Just maintenance, optimization of existing assets, defensive positions protecting established monopolies.

Sterling was profitable. Stable. Risk-averse.

Perfect.

From the travel bag at Victor's feet, the faintest hint of muffled breathing suggested Zip was maintaining discipline. Good. The kobold was learning.

Forty minutes passed. Victor used them to mentally map exit routes, count visible staff, and calculate Sterling's operational overhead.

Then the door opened.

---

Lord Sterling didn't swagger. Walked like a man who'd commanded soldiers and managed territories with neither time nor patience for theater.

Mid-forties, military bearing, expensive clothing cut for function—quality materials, practical design. The kind of man who'd earned his position through competence, not pure inheritance.

Dangerous, in other words.

Victor's ARMI interface flickered.

> **[PERFORMANCE REVIEW - PARTIAL ANALYSIS]**
> Target: Lord Aldric Sterling
> Level: 18-20 (estimated, combat-focused build)
> Class: Warrior/Noble (hybrid specialization)
> Threat Assessment: High (authority + capability)
> Weakness Detected: Risk-averse decision-making patterns
> Recommendation: Offer certainty over gambles

Sterling sat behind his desk with the ease of someone who'd negotiated from this position hundreds of times.

"My men say you have a business opportunity," he said without preamble. "I'm listening."

Professional. Efficient. Victor approved.

"Lord Sterling," Victor began, keeping his tone respectful but not obsequious. "Your dungeon monopoly is impressive. Smart governance—control the resource extraction, collect licensing fees, eliminate unlicensed competition. Textbook territorial economics."

Sterling's expression didn't shift. "Flattery wastes both our time."

"That wasn't flattery. That was acknowledgment of competent business architecture." Victor pulled his prepared documentation—Nova's expertly forged merchant papers—from his pack. "But monopolies have natural limits. You control supply. I can expand your market."

"Explain."

"I represent a managed dungeon operation. Not random monster spawning and adventurer casualties. Organized infrastructure. Quality-controlled product output. Scalable revenue streams." Victor slid the trade manifests across the desk. "The slime cores your men questioned? Those are entry-level samples. I have access to premium materials at volumes your current dungeons can't match."

Sterling examined the documentation with the careful attention of someone who'd seen forgeries. His eyes tracked across certification seals, toll clearance stamps, quality grades.

Victor had counted on Sterling's professionalism. Amateurs missed details. Experts caught inconsistencies. Victor had ensured there were none to catch.

"Impressive paperwork," Sterling said finally. "But you haven't answered the obvious question."

"Which is?"

"What stops me from simply confiscating your inventory and eliminating a potential competitor?"

Victor smiled. This was the moment that separated negotiators from thugs.

"Short-term extraction versus long-term revenue optimization," Victor said. "You confiscate my current stock—let's say fifty crystals at 100 GP each. That's 5,000 Gold Pieces one time. Congratulations. You've made this quarter's numbers."

He leaned forward slightly.

"Or you partner with my operation. Fifteen percent gross revenue on managed dungeon output that generates 50,000 GP annually. Sustainable. Scalable. No operational costs on your end—just licensing legitimization and regulatory protection."

Sterling's fingers drummed once on the desk. Calculating.

"Thirty percent."

"Twenty. I handle all operational expenses. You collect percentages on revenue you're not accessing."

"Twenty-five."

"Twenty, plus a performance clause—if revenue exceeds projections by fifteen percent, you get a bonus tier. Effective twenty-three percent."

Sterling's eyes narrowed fractionally. Not suspicion—recognition.

"You negotiate like a merchant who's done this before."

"I've restructured operations more inefficient than this," Victor said honestly. "I know what sustainable partnerships look like."

Sterling leaned back, studying him with the intensity of someone re-evaluating initial assumptions.

"You're not a simple trader."

"No."

"What are you?"

Victor pulled the black Consortium card from his inner pocket. Didn't explain it. Didn't need to. Just placed it on the desk where Sterling could see the metallic surface, the impossible-to-forge materials, the markings that suggested institutional backing far beyond regional merchant guilds.

Sterling's expression shifted.

Not fear. Not quite. But... recognition of something larger than expected.

"That's—" Sterling started.

The door burst open.

A messenger—young, professional, clearly trained not to interrupt unless critical—entered with barely controlled urgency.

"My Lord, forgive the interruption, but there's been an incident."

Sterling's attention snapped to the messenger with the focus of a commander receiving battlefield intelligence.

"Report."

"The eastern dungeon, my Lord. Three adventurer parties entered this morning. None have returned. We sent a runner to investigate." The messenger's voice carried professional control over what was clearly disturbing information. "The dungeon's... changed, sir. The runner who made it back said the monsters are organized. Setting coordinated traps. Working together like—like soldiers, not beasts."

Victor felt the calculation shift.

Sterling's gaze returned to him with sudden, sharp focus.

"You said you represent a 'managed dungeon operation,'" Sterling said slowly. "Which dungeon?"

Victor ran the risk assessment in the seconds it took Sterling's hand to drift toward the ornamental sword hanging behind his desk.

Options:

1. **Deny everything** - Maintain merchant cover, claim coincidence (Low credibility, damages negotiation foundation)
2. **Deflect responsibility** - Blame dungeon changes on natural evolution (Transparent lie, insults Sterling's intelligence)
3. **Leverage the revelation** - Admit ownership, demonstrate value (High risk, high reward - establishes credibility or triggers immediate arrest)

Victor chose strategy.

"The tutorial dungeon," he said calmly. "Two days west of here. And those 'organized monsters' are my employees."

Sterling stood. His hand settled on the sword hilt.

Not drawing. Not yet. But the threat clear.

"You're telling me," Sterling said with dangerous quiet, "that you're responsible for the dungeon causing me operational problems."

"I'm telling you," Victor corrected, not standing, projecting calm confidence, "that I solved a market inefficiency. Your old dungeon was generating what—maybe fifty Gold Pieces annually in licensing fees? Random adventurer casualties, unpredictable loot spawning, zero quality control?"

He met Sterling's eyes directly.

"I optimized it. Implemented management structure, trained the workforce, established sustainable operations. And I'm offering to do the same for your other dungeons—with you receiving licensing percentages on revenue streams that don't currently exist."

"Or," Sterling said, "I arrest you now, seize your operation, and claim the improved efficiency for myself."

Victor smiled.

This was the moment he'd prepared for since leaving the dungeon. The contingency Earth had taught him to never travel without.

"Try," Victor said pleasantly. "My dungeon is two days from here, fully operational under delegated management authority. I have standing instructions: if I don't return within seventy-two hours, they seal the entrance and collapse the primary access tunnels using strategic demolition charges I installed before departure."

Sterling's hand tightened on the sword.

Victor continued, voice never losing professional courtesy.

"You'd get nothing. I'd die, yes, but you'd lose access to the one managed dungeon in your territory, alienate every merchant who hears about arresting legitimate business consultants, and spend the next six months explaining to your territorial administration why dungeon revenue dropped to zero."

He pulled a sealed document from his jacket—Nova had prepared it beautifully, complete with wax seals and legal terminology.

"Or you sign a provisional partnership agreement. Twenty percent licensing fees. Regulated operations. No more 'incident' reports because I'll manage the difficulty curves to maximize survivable challenge without excessive casualties. Better for your reputation, better for my revenue, better for the adventurers who actually make it out alive to spend gold in your territory."

The room held silence.

Sterling's expression was unreadable—combat veteran's discipline preventing emotional telegraphing.

From Victor's travel bag, the faintest rustle suggested Zip fighting every instinct to peek out and observe.

Then Sterling released the sword hilt.

Sat down.

Pulled the provisional agreement toward him and read with methodical attention.

Victor waited. Didn't push. Gave Sterling space to make the decision that benefited him most.

After three minutes of careful review, Sterling spoke.

"This agreement includes provisions for operational audits."

"Standard oversight. You receive quarterly revenue reports and can inspect operations with forty-eight hours notice."

"And the dead-man switch?"

"Remains in place until our partnership demonstrates mutual benefit. After six months of successful collaboration, I'll provide you access codes to dungeon administration. As insurance against my sudden demise."

Sterling's pen hovered over the signature line.

"If you're lying about any of this—the revenue projections, the operational control, the sustainability—I will personally ensure your operation ends and you along with it."

"I don't lie, Lord Sterling." Victor's voice carried absolute certainty. "I'm expensive, I'm ruthless, and I optimize for profit over ethics. But I don't breach contracts. Bad for long-term reputation."

Sterling signed.

Slid the document across.

Victor signed.

Sterling extended his hand.

Victor shook it. Firm grip. Professional courtesy between equals who'd just negotiated mutual advantage.

"Welcome to the Oakhaven commercial ecosystem," Sterling said. "Don't make me regret this."

"I'll make you richer instead," Victor replied. "Much more sustainable motivation."

Sterling almost smiled. Almost.

"My men will provide you with provisional operating permits. You'll need to present to the Merchant Guild for formal licensing, but my endorsement should expedite approval." He paused. "And the three missing adventurer parties?"

"I'll send word to my operations manager immediately. They'll be released with standard severance packages—minor healing potions, trauma counseling, and professional recommendations to avoid dungeon employment conflicts in future."

Sterling's expression suggested he wasn't sure if Victor was joking.

Victor wasn't.

---

An hour later, Victor walked from Sterling Manor with legitimate permits, territorial endorsement, and the beginning of what might become the most profitable protection racket in regional history.

Zip poked his head from the bag. "Boss make deal! Many synergies!"

"Synergies, Zip."

"Zip learning!"

Victor walked toward Oakhaven proper, toward the Consortium waypoint still waiting for black card activation, toward civilization and opportunity and the next phase of expansion.

Behind him, Sterling Manor represented old power beginning to align with new methodology.

And two days west, Sniv was managing twenty-six goblins while Asterion guarded floors and Nova monitored systems.

The Manager of the Universe had just acquired his first external partnership.

Time to see what Oakhaven's markets looked like.

And whether the Consortium waypoint was surveillance infrastructure or opportunity.

Victor smiled.

Let the expansion begin.
