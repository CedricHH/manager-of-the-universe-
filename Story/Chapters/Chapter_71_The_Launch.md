# Chapter 71: The Launch

The first Ember Trials poster went up in Oakhaven's Adventurer District at dawn.

By midday, twelve parties had registered.

By sunset, Director Malcom of the Gilded Ledger was reading the same poster with visible anger.

The poster itself was simple:

> **THE EMBER TRIALS**
>
> Weekly Tournament - Floor 5: Volcanic Arena
>
> Defeat Ignatia, the Ember Tyrant
>
> Prize: 500 GP (Winner Takes All)
>
> Entry Fee: 50 GP per party
>
> Spectators Welcome: 50 GP per seat
>
> Leaderboards. Glory. Fame.
>
> *First Trial: Sixthday, Noon*

Victor watched from his administrative office as the registration queue stretched down the corridor.

Zip, the kobold accountant, managed the sign-ups with methodical efficiency—clipboard in one hand, stamp in the other.

"Next!" Zip called.

A party of five stepped forward: mismatched armor, over-eager expressions, probably Level 14 at best.

"Fifty gold," Zip said flatly.

The leader—a human fighter with a chipped sword—counted out the coins.

Zip stamped their registration form.

"You're Party Seven. Trial begins at noon. Don't be late."

Victor leaned back in his chair.

**Twelve parties × 50 GP = 600 GP.**

And that was just the entry fees.

\u003e **[ARMI]**
\u003e Transaction: Registration Fees (Ember Trials - Week 1)
\u003e Revenue: 600 GP | Prize Pool: 500 GP
\u003e Spectator Revenue: Pending
\u003e Status: APPROVED

He pulled up a projection:

If even six spectators attended per party (conservative estimate), that was 72 spectator seats.

**72 × 50 GP = 3,600 GP.**

Plus entry fees.

**Total projected revenue: 4,200 GP.**

For one day.

Victor allowed himself a rare smile.

"I'm not charging them to use my dungeon," he murmured. "I'm charging them to compete in it."

***

**Registration Day**

The dungeon entrance was chaos.

Twelve parties milled about, sizing each other up.

Some were veterans—Crimson Blades stood near the entrance, calm and professional, their red armor gleaming.

Others were newcomers—a party of gnomes with way too many potions, a duo of overconfident rogues, a cleric who kept nervously checking his holy symbol.

Theron, leader of the Crimson Blades, walked over to Victor.

"This is brilliant," Theron said quietly.

Victor raised an eyebrow.

"You've weaponized our competitive instincts," Theron continued. "We're literally paying you to fight each other for your prize money."

Victor's expression didn't change.

"I prefer 'monetized.'"

Theron laughed. "Of course you do."

He glanced back at the other parties.

"We're going to win this, you know."

"I'm counting on it," Victor said. "Someone has to set the benchmark."

***

At exactly noon, Zip rang the ceremonial gong.

"**First party: Iron Hammers!**"

A party of five dwarves stepped forward, weapons drawn.

They looked confident.

Too confident.

Victor gestured toward the obsidian gateway.

"Floor Five. Your time starts the moment you cross the threshold."

The Iron Hammers marched through.

The crowd—eight paying spectators, plus a few dungeon employees—gathered around the magical projection screens that Victor had installed in a designated viewing room.

The screens showed live footage from Floor 5: three angles, real-time tracking.

Victor stood at the back, arms crossed, watching.

***

**The First Trial**

The Iron Hammers entered the volcanic arena with all the subtlety of a battering ram.

"Spread out!" their leader—a stocky dwarf named Grendor—shouted. "Watch for environmental hazards!"

They navigated the lava moat, avoided the sulfur vents, and reached the central platform in fourteen minutes.

Not bad.

Then Ignatia appeared.

The dragon descended from her perch with a theatrical roar, wings spread, flames licking the edges of her jaw.

"**WELCOME, MORTALS**," she intoned. "**YOU DARE CHALLENGE THE EMBER TYRANT?**"

Grendor hefted his warhammer. "Aye! And we'll take your treasure!"

Ignatia's eyes gleamed.

"**THEN BOW... OR BURN**."

***

**Phase One: The Assault**

The Iron Hammers didn't bow.

They charged.

Ignatia met them with a breath attack—**Flame Torrent**—a sweeping cone of fire that forced the party to scatter.

Their healer threw up a protective barrier.

It held.

Barely.

Grendor circled left, trying to flank.

Ignatia's tail whipped around, slamming him into the arena wall.

**-40 HP.**

"Healer!" Grendor gasped.

The cleric was already casting.

**+30 HP.**

Meanwhile, their rogue attempted a backstab—daggers aimed at Ignatia's exposed underbelly.

The blades scraped uselessly off her scales.

"Armor's too thick!" the rogue yelled.

Ignatia's claws raked across him.

**-35 HP.**

***

**Phase Two: The Mistake**

At 70% health, Ignatia's wings ignited.

**Phase Two.**

She launched into the air, circling the arena.

"SCATTER!" Grendor screamed.

Ignatia unleashed **Meteor Dive**—a vertical plunge wreathed in flame.

She aimed for the healer.

The Iron Hammers' mage threw up an ice wall.

It shattered on impact.

The healer took the full hit.

**-120 HP.**

He dropped.

Dead.

The crowd gasped.

Grendor's voice cracked. "Retreat! We can't—"

Ignatia didn't give them time.

**Inferno Pulse.**

A shockwave of fire erupted from her wings.

The remaining four party members were caught in the blast.

All down.

Total party wipe.

***

In the viewing room, silence.

Then one spectator muttered: "They didn't even get her to Phase Three."

Another: "Pathetic."

Victor updated the leaderboard projection:

\u003e **EMBER TRIALS - LEADERBOARD**
\u003e
\u003e 1. Iron Hammers - **FAILED** - 18:42 runtime

He glanced at the spectators.

Eight of them.

**8 × 50 GP = 400 GP.**

For a *failed* run.

Victor's mind was already calculating.

If twelve parties ran today, and each attracted an average of six spectators...

**Projected spectator revenue: 3,600 GP.**

For watching people *lose*.

He made a mental note: "Failure is as profitable as success."

***

**The Breakthrough Run**

By the time Crimson Blades took the floor, the viewing room was packed.

Twenty-three spectators.

Word had spread.

Victor stood beside Valerius, who was taking notes.

"Boss," Valerius whispered. "We're at capacity. People are offering double to get in."

Victor's expression remained neutral.

"Note that for next time."

On screen, Crimson Blades entered the arena.

Theron led, shield raised.

Mira (healer) stayed center-back, staff glowing.

Elena (mage) and Kael (rogue) flanked.

Garrick (archer) hung back, arrows nocked.

Professional.

Ignatia descended.

"**AH. THE CRIMSON BLADES**," she said, voice dripping with amusement. "**YOU RETURN**."

Theron slammed his shield into the ground.

"We're here for the prize, dragon. Let's make this good."

Ignatia grinned—a terrifying expression on a fifteen-foot dragon.

"**AGREED**."

***

**Phase One: Precision**

The Crimson Blades moved like a machine.

Theron absorbed Ignatia's initial Flame Torrent with his shield, his boots planted firm.

Elena countered with **Frost Lance**—targeting Ignatia's wings to reduce mobility.

Kael used the distraction to grapple onto Ignatia's back, slashing at exposed scale joints.

Garrick fired explosive arrows at her eyes—forcing her to flinch, disrupting her breath attacks.

Mira maintained **Holy Aegis**—a rotating barrier that absorbed 30% of incoming damage.

At 70% health, Ignatia transitioned.

**Phase Two.**

Wings ignited.

Aerial assault.

But Crimson Blades anticipated it.

Elena flash-froze Ignatia's left wing mid-flight.

The dragon crashed to the ground, roaring in fury.

Theron charged, shield bash to the jaw.

**Stun: 3 seconds.**

Kael and Garrick unloaded damage.

At 40% health, Ignatia's chest began glowing white-hot.

**Phase Three.**

"ULTIMATE INCOMING!" Elena screamed. "SCATTER!"

**INFERNO BURST.**

A fifty-foot radius explosion of flame.

Mira threw up a **Divine Shield**—a golden hemisphere that absorbed the blast.

The shield shattered.

But the party survived.

Theron, bleeding from a dozen cuts, raised his sword.

"FINISH HER!"

Garrick's final arrow—**Dragonslayer Bolt**—pierced Ignatia's heart.

She collapsed.

The crowd erupted.

***

**Victory**

Victor walked onto Floor 5 personally for the award ceremony.

The Crimson Blades stood around Ignatia's corpse, battered but victorious.

Theron's HP: 43/180.

Mira: 89/150.

Elena: 67/140.

Kael: 51/130.

Garrick: 78/120.

They'd won.

Barely.

Victor approached, holding a leather pouch.

"Congratulations," he said. "Five hundred gold."

Theron accepted it, grinning despite the exhaustion.

"Worth every second."

Victor's expression was unreadable.

"You've earned the right to be hunted."

Theron blinked. "Hunted?"

"Every party in Oakhaven now knows your time," Victor said. "Twenty-four minutes, seventeen seconds. And they'll all be back to beat it."

Theron's grin widened.

"Good. Let them try."

Victor turned to leave.

\u003e **[ARMI]**
\u003e Ember Trials - Week 1, Day 1 (Final Report)
\u003e Revenue: 600 GP (Entries) + 1,150 GP (Spectators) = 1,750 GP
\u003e Costs: 500 GP (Prize) + 50 GP (Operations) = 550 GP
\u003e **Net Profit: 1,200 GP**
\u003e Monthly Projection: 4,800 GP (sustainable growth confirmed)

Victor paused at the gateway.

He glanced back at the leaderboard:

\u003e **EMBER TRIALS - LEADERBOARD**
\u003e
\u003e 1. Crimson Blades - **VICTORY** - 24:17
\u003e 2. Iron Hammers - **FAILED** - 18:42
\u003e 3. [Nine other parties - various results]

He allowed himself the smallest smile.

"Not bad for Day One."

***

**Malcom's Response**

Across town, in the Bank of the Gilded Ledger, Director Malcom stared at an intelligence report.

His assistant stood nervously by the door.

"Seventeen hundred gold," Malcom read aloud. "In one day."

"Yes, sir."

Malcom set the report down.

"He's not running a dungeon anymore. He's created a self-sustaining revenue engine."

"Sir?"

Malcom stood, pacing to the window.

Outside, Oakhaven bustled—merchants, adventurers, coin changing hands.

"The loan was leverage," Malcom said quietly. "I expected him to struggle with repayment. To need extensions. To give me control."

He turned.

"But if this tournament model works, he won't need me at all."

The assistant hesitated. "What do we do?"

Malcom's jaw tightened.

"Accelerate the plan. I want options on my desk by morning."

"Options, sir?"

"Surveillance. Leverage. Pressure points." Malcom's voice was cold. "If I can't profit from him, I'll make sure no one does."

He gestured toward the door.

"And contact our friends in the Church. It's time we reminded Victor that visibility has a price."

***

**The Cliffhanger**

Victor returned to his office after sunset.

Valerius was waiting, expression tense.

"Boss. We have a problem."

Victor sat, pulling up the day's financial summary.

"Define 'problem.'"

"Three different Guild scouts were in the viewing room today."

Victor didn't look up. "Expected. Merchant's Guild wants a partnership. Let them watch."

"Not just Merchant's Guild," Valerius said. "Alchemist's Guild was there too. And..."

Valerius hesitated.

Victor finally looked up.

"And?"

"Church of Eternal Light."

Victor went still.

"The Church sent scouts?"

"Not scouts," Valerius corrected. "An observer. High-ranking. He didn't hide his insignia."

Victor's mind raced.

The Ember Trials had succeeded.

**Too well.**

High visibility meant high risk.

The dungeon was no longer just an asset.

It was a *strategic* asset.

And everyone knew it.

\u003e **[ARMI - ALERT]**
\u003e Risk Assessment: Multiple hostile acquisition attempts detected
\u003e Threat Level: MODERATE → HIGH
\u003e Recommendation: Diversify defensive protocols
\u003e **New Skill Available: [Reputation Management]**

Victor stared at the projection.

"We wanted attention," he said quietly. "Seems we got it."

A knock at the door.

Zip entered, holding a sealed envelope.

"Boss. Magical courier just delivered this."

Victor took the envelope.

The seal: Church of Eternal Light.

He broke it open.

One line:

\u003e *"Invitation to Audit. Three days. Non-negotiable. - High Priestess Aurelia"*

Victor set the letter down.

Valerius looked pale. "Boss... what do we do?"

Victor leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled.

"We prepare," he said. "The Church wants an audit? Fine. We'll give them one they'll never forget."

He pulled up a new ARMI interface.

"Valerius. Gather the team. I want full financial records, compliance documentation, and contingency plans by tomorrow morning."

"And if they try to shut us down?"

Victor's expression was cold.

"Then they'll learn the same lesson the Bank did."

He glanced at the Ember Trials leaderboard, still glowing on the wall.

"No one shuts down a brand this profitable."

***

**STATUS**: Ember Trials Day 1 successful. Revenue: 1,750 GP. Net profit: 1,200 GP. Church of Eternal Light audit scheduled in 3 days. Multiple hostile factions monitoring. Defensive protocols initiated.
