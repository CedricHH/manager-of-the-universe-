## The Tutorial Dungeon System

### What is a Dungeon?

Dungeons in Terra-Insolvia are not natural formations. They are **living economic entities** through which the "Loosh Harvest" is conducted.

#### The Loosh Harvest
**Concept:**
- **Loosh**: Metaphysical energy derived from sentient suffering (fear, pain, despair).
- **The Harvest**: Higher beings "farm" this energy, treating dungeons as agricultural plots and adventurers as the crop to be harvested.

| Aspect   | Reality                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Origin   | Created by Dungeon Cores (ancient constructs)    |
| Purpose  | Generate monsters, harvest adventurer deaths     |
| Currency | Soul energy from kills → converted to expansion |
| Status   | Legally "unclaimed territory" (exploitable)      |

### Dungeon Hierarchy

### The Problem

Tutorial dungeons exist to train newbie adventurers. They're designed to be BEATEN.

Core-7749 has never grown because it keeps dying to heroes.

## Monster Economics

### Monster Types & Value

| Type            | Cost to Spawn | Gold Dropped | Loot Quality |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Goblin          | 5 GP          | 2 GP         | Trash        |
| Hobgoblin       | 25 GP         | 15 GP        | Common       |
| Orc             | 50 GP         | 40 GP        | Uncommon     |
| Troll           | 200 GP        | 150 GP       | Rare         |
| Boss (Asterion) | 5,000 GP      | 2,000 GP     | Epic         |

### Victor's Optimization

Instead of spawning monsters to die:

- Monsters become **employees** (e.g., Rats contracted for non-aggression via food bribes - Ch 5)
- Adventurers become **customers** (pay to leave alive)
- Death becomes **optional revenue**, not primary income

---

## The Loot System

### Standard Loot Tables

Dungeons generate loot based on:

1. Monster tier killed
2. Floor depth
3. Random variance

### Victor's Modification

- **Loot is now salary** (monsters keep equipment)
- **Drops are negotiable** (adventurers can buy items directly)
- **Quality improves with employment length**

---

## Adventurer Guild Relations

### Standard Protocol

Adventurer Guild controls dungeon access:

- Registers adventurers
- Maps dungeons
- Collects "clearing fees"
- Claims 20% of all loot

### Victor's Disruption

Victor's dungeon operates **outside Guild control**:

- No registration required
- Flat entry fee (cheaper)
- 100% loot retention for adventurers
- But... survival not guaranteed

This creates conflict (Arc 1, Act 3).

## Key Locations

### Floor 1: Entry Hall

- Goblin territory (now Victor's reception)
- Trap corridor (visitor processing)
- Safe room (contract signing area)

### Floor 2: Fungal Gardens

- Slime spawning ground (potion ingredients)
- Mushroom forest (food production)
- Victor's "Agriculture Department"

### Floor 3: The Mines

- Ore deposits (raw materials)
- Mining goblins (resource extraction)
- Treasury vault (Victor's capital storage)

### Floor 4: The Labyrinth

- Asterion's territory
- Trap-heavy maze
- "Security Checkpoint"

### Floor 5: Boss Chamber

- Asterion's throne room
- Contract archive
- "Executive Suite"

---

## Economic Rules

### Gold-Mana Parity

For Victor, gold and mana are interchangeable:

- 1 GP = 1 Mana Point
- Monsters cost mana to spawn
- Kills generate gold for Core
- Victor's ARMI converts freely

### Respawn Mechanics

- Common monsters: 24-hour respawn
- Elites: 7-day respawn
- Bosses: 30-day respawn (or instant if Core pays 10x cost)

Victor negotiates: No respawn. Permanent employees.

## Arc 1 Conflict Points

1. **Resource Scarcity**: Starting with zero capital
2. **Monster Loyalty**: Convincing creatures to work, not fight
3. **Guild Interference**: External authorities noticing profit
4. **Adventurer Expectations**: Customers wanting "normal" dungeon experience
