## Political Structure

### The Crown

| Role | Person | Situation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| King | Aldric IV | Desperate, hiding bankruptcy |
| Queen | Deceased | Died of "illness" (stress) |
| Crown Prince | Aldric II | Sent to investigate Victor |
| Second Prince | Maximilian | Plotting coup |
| Third Princess | Seraphina | Sold to Victor as collateral |

### The Great Houses

| House | Domain | Strength | Loyalty |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Valdris** | Crown | Declining | N/A |
| **Ironwood** | North | Military | Questionable |
| **Goldmere** | East | Banking | For sale |
| **Blackthorn** | West | Agriculture | Hungry |
| **Stormwind** | Coast | Navy | Underpaid |

### Victor's Strategy

Don't conquer houses—**BUY their debts**.

House Goldmere's debts → Victor's leverage
House Stormwind's unpaid sailors → Victor's navy
House Blackthorn's failed harvests → Victor's food monopoly

## The Royal Court

### Factions

| Faction | Goal | Leader |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Royalists** | Preserve monarchy | King Aldric IV |
| **Reformists** | Modernize kingdom | Prince Aldric II |
| **Traditionalists** | Return to old ways | Duke Ironwood |
| **Opportunists** | Personal gain | Various nobles |
| **Church Bloc** | Theocratic influence | High Priestess Aurelia |

### Court Intrigue

- Everyone knows the kingdom is failing
- No one admits it publicly
- Blame is constantly shifted
- Victor provides a convenient scapegoat... until he doesn't

## The Restructurer Conflict

### #402: The Necromancer

Another Consortium agent operates in Valdris:

| Aspect | #402 | Victor |
|--------|------|--------|
| Method | Undead labor | Contract labor |
| Currency | Corpses | Gold |
| Expansion | Conquest | Acquisition |
| Sustainability | Infinite (if corpses exist) | Compound growth |

### The War

#402's undead armies threaten Victor's supply chains:
- Dead workers don't buy products
- Corpse-based economy has no consumers
- Victor must eliminate #402 to preserve markets

Solution: Make corpses legally protected. Funeral industry boom.

## Military Structure

### Royal Army (Theoretical)

| Unit | Size | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Royal Guard | 2,000 | Loyal, equipped |
| Line Infantry | 25,000 | Underpaid, poorly equipped |
| Cavalry | 5,000 | Nobles' personal forces |
| Siege Engineers | 1,000 | Outdated equipment |
| Navy | 50 ships | 30 need repairs |

### Victor's Military Solution

Don't build an army—**contract existing forces**.

Royal Guard → Offered better contracts
Line Infantry → Victor promises back pay
Nobles' cavalry → Their debts become Victor's leverage

## The Hero Problem

### Lysander Brightheart

The gods' response to Victor: A TRUE Chosen Hero.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Blessing | Divine (genuine) |
| Combat | Exceptional |
| Charisma | Inspiring |
| Weakness | Believes in institutions |

### The Confrontation

Lysander rallies the people against "The Manager."

Victor's response: Not combat. **Truth.**

Show Lysander: The kingdom he defends is rotten. The institutions he trusts are corrupt. Victor, for all his evil, DELIVERS results.

Lysander's faith breaks. He joins Victor—not through debt, but despair.
