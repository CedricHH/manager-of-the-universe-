## The Continent of Aethermoor

### Major Powers

| Nation | Government | Specialty | Stance on Victor |
|--------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Valdris** | Victor-controlled | Manufacturing | Home base |
| **Solarian Dominion** | Fading empire | Legitimacy | Surrenders |
| **Holy Republic of Theron** | Theocracy | Military | Holy war declared |
| **Merchant States of Keth** | Trade oligarchy | Banking | Competitive alliance |
| **Northern Clans** | Tribal council | Mining | For sale |
| **Demon Realm** | Corporate monarchy | Soul trade | Negotiations |

---

## The Holy Alliance

### Formation (Ch 605)

Five nations unite against "The Manager":

| Member | Contribution | Weakness |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Holy Republic | 50,000 troops | Fanaticism (can't negotiate) |
| Northern Clans | 10,000 berserkers | Internal divisions |
| Theron Navy | 80 warships | Victor owns their debt |
| Remnant Kingdoms | 20,000 militia | Poor equipment |
| Church Coalition | Moral authority | Already losing followers |

### Victor's Counter

He doesn't fight. He **starves**.

- Trade embargo on Alliance ports
- Currency manipulation (their money becomes worthless)
- Defection offers (better contracts for deserters)
- Information warfare (exposing their leaders' corruption)

By Ch 680, the Alliance collapses from economics, not combat.

## The Solarian Dominion

### Emperor Valkorin's Deal

| Victor Gets | Valkorin Gets |
|-------------|---------------|
| 200-year legitimacy | Funding to revive empire |
| Royal endorsement | Victor manages economy |
| Historical prestige | Comfortable retirement |

### The Merger

Solaria becomes Victor's "senior brand":
- Old money legitimacy
- New money efficiency
- Best of both worlds

---

## The Demon Realm

### Not Chaos—Capitalism

The Abyssal Conglomerate is the OLDEST corporation:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Age | 10,000+ years |
| Structure | Corporate hierarchy |
| Currency | Souls |
| Contract Law | Binding (literally) |
| CEO | Demon King Malachar |

### The Negotiation

Victor cannot conquer demons. They're too powerful, too experienced.

But he can **partner**.

| Victor Offers | Demons Get |
|---------------|------------|
| Living labor contracts | No soul harvesting needed |
| Surface trade access | New markets |
| Regulatory expertise | Efficiency improvements |
| Legitimacy laundering | Reduced hero attacks |

**Result**: North-Abyss Trade Accord (Ch 730)

## The Dragon Situation

### Kharzul's Hoard

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gold stored | 47 billion GP |
| Invested | 0 GP |
| Annual growth | 0% |
| Victor's assessment | "Criminal waste" |

### The Solution

Dragons guard gold. Victor GROWS gold.

Joint venture:
- Victor manages 80% of hoard
- Kharzul keeps 20% "comfort gold"
- Annual returns: 3% (1.4 billion GP/year)
- Dragon provides: Air superiority, terror factor

---

## Maritime Powers

### Captain Reva's Domain

The Shattered Isles control all sea lanes:

| Asset | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Ships | 200+ |
| Pirates | 15,000 |
| Trade routes | All of them |
| Legitimacy | None (until Victor) |

### The Stormborn Trading Company

Victor legitimizes piracy:
- "Privateers" become "shipping contractors"
- Smuggling becomes "expedited customs"
- Piracy becomes "competitive logistics"

Reva gets: Legal empire
Victor gets: Naval supremacy

---

## Economic Warfare Tools

### Currency Manipulation

Victor's banks control exchange rates:
- Enemy currency devalued
- Ally currency stabilized  
- Create inflation in hostile nations

### Trade Embargoes

Control what flows:
- Food shortages → Political instability
- Weapon shortages → Military weakness
- Luxury shortages → Noble discontent

### Information Warfare

Kira's network provides:
- Corruption evidence on enemy leaders
- Economic intelligence
- Market manipulation triggers

---

## God of Commerce: Aurum

### The Dying Goddess

Before Victor: 847 worshippers
After Victor: 2.3 million

Victor's "Prosperity Doctrine" teaches:
- Work hard → Get rewards
- Contracts are sacred
- Fair exchange benefits all

This is AURUM'S DOMAIN. She gains power.

### The Alliance

Aurum offers divine backing:
- Blessings on contracts
- Curses on contract-breakers
- Direct communication channel
- Access to divine bureaucracy
