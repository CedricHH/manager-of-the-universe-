# Galactic Audit Consortium

> **Role**: Cosmic Regulatory Body / " The System Admins"
> **First Appearance**: Chapter 27 (Mentioned)

---

## Overview

The **Galactic Audit Consortium** is the entity responsible for the distribution of "Systems," the management of Isekai transmigrations, and the oversight of cosmic resource allocation. They view universes not as stories, but as **marketplaces**.

## Relationship to Victor Kaine

- **Creator**: They created the ARMI System.
- **Observer**: They have flagged Victor for "Elevated Observation" due to his anomalous efficiency.
- **Classification**: "Priority Asset Monitoring".
- **Directive**: "Do Not Interfere... Yet." (Chapter 30)

## Known History

- **Year 0**: Created Dungeon Core-7749 (and likely others).
- **Year 1159 (Current)**: Re-focused attention on the Tutorial Dungeon due to Victor's activities.

## Philosophy

"Efficiency is the only virtue. Profit is the only metric."
(Deduced from ARMI's behavior)

## The Harvest (Ch 32/33 Discovery)

The Consortium views worlds not as places to be saved, but as **experiments** and **livestock** ("Preparing the crop").

- **Phase 1: Seeding**: Worlds are "seeded" with magic, monsters, and systems.
- **Phase 2: Development**: Monitored by Restructurers to maximize value (Mana, Souls, Resources).
- **Phase 3: Harvest**: Once a "critical value" threshold is met, the Consortium "harvests" the world (liquidation of all resources and souls).

**Timeline (Terra-Insolvia)**:

- **Final Processing** was originally scheduled for **500 years after R#1's arrival** (approx. 1,500 years ago).
- **The Delay**: Restructurer #1 thwarted the harvest by hiding processing codes and refusing orders.
- **Current Status**: Victor has been sent to "finish the job" (re-initiate harvest).

**Restructurer #1**:

- The first administrator assigned to Terra-Insolvia.
- Discovered the true nature of "Restructuring" as strip-mining.
- Built the Vault on Floor 3 to hide information and sabotage the harvest.
- Died in isolation after the Consortium terminated their ARMI support.
- Left the **Black Card** as leverage for their successor.

## The Galactic Exchange

**First Full Access**: Chapter 89

### Overview

The **Galactic Exchange** is an inter-dimensional marketplace operated by the Consortium. It connects gods, demons, cosmic entities, and Restructurers across infinite worlds, allowing them to trade resources, miracles, souls, and other cosmic commodities.

### Interface

- **Access Method**: Obsidian Consortium Contract Card (holographic projection)
- **Signal Strength**: Varies by location (14% on Terra-Insolvia highways)
- **Format**: Scrolling ticker + listing database + chat system

### Commodity Types

| Category | Examples | Pricing Currencies |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Divine Assets** | Miracles (Rain, Harvest), Blessings, Wards | GP, Faith Points, Soul Fragments |
| **Cosmic Resources** | Planetary Cores, Mana Wells, Prayer Futures | Planetary Cores, Cosmic Shards |
| **Enforcement** | Curses, Contracts, Divine Wrath | GP, Sworn Oaths |
| **Information** | Prophecies, Scrying, Fate Threads | GP, Future Favors |

### Reputation System

**Purpose**: Prevents market manipulation by new users.

| Tier | Status | Weekly Purchase Limit | Requirements |
|------|--------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Unverified** | Entry Level | 25,000 GP/week | 0 transactions |
| **Tier 1** | Basic Contractor | 100,000 GP/week | 10 verified transactions |
| **Tier 2** | Established Trader | ??? | ??? + Shell Entity Access |

**Victor's Status (Ch 89)**: Unverified (1/10 transactions complete)

### Transaction Features

1. **Mana Lock Escrow**: Smart contract holding payment until delivery confirmed
2. **Dimensional Vault Storage**: Items stored at dimensional nodes, retrievable at Waypoints
3. **Seller Anonymity Options**: Public / Anonymous / Shell Entity (Tier 2+)
4. **Verification Runes**: Built-in authenticity checking for divine/magical items

### Security & Tracking

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY (Ch 89)**: Every transaction leaves a **mana signature**.

- Transactions can be traced back to the buyer/seller
- Flooding local markets triggers "destabilizing trade" alerts
- Affected parties (e.g., Church monopolies) can track signature back to source
- Consortium monitors for trades that "crash markets"

**Hestia's Warning**: "If you crash a local market, the affected parties will notice. And they have your signature now."

### Arbitrage Potential

Victor identified massive price disparities:

| Item | Purchase Price (Other Worlds) | Terra-Insolvia Market Rate | ROI |
|------|------------------------------|---------------------------|-----|
| [Miracle: Rain] | 5,000 GP | 50,000-120,000 GP | 900-2,300% |
| [Blessing: Fertile Soil] | 2,500 GP | 75,000 GP | 2,900% |
| [Ward: Plague Protection] | 8,000 GP | 120,000 GP | 1,400% |

**Root Cause**: Information asymmetry. Entities across worlds don't price-compare or arbitrage.
