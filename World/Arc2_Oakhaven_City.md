## The Church of Eternal Light

### Structure

```
HIGH COUNCIL (5 Archbishops)
    ↓
HIGH PRIESTESS AURELIA (Regional Authority)
    ↓
TEMPLE PRIESTS (City Operations)
    ↓
PALADINS & CLERICS (Enforcement)
    ↓
FAITHFUL (Revenue Source)
```

### The Pyramid Scheme

The Church operates as a religious corporation:
- **Tithes**: 10% of income from all faithful
- **Miracles**: Paid services (healing, blessings)
- **Indulgences**: Pay to remove sins
- **Loans**: Church-affiliated lenders at 40% interest

### Why Lyra Fell

The Church only helps those who can PAY. Lyra's family couldn't.

## Political Power Structure

### The Mayor

- **Current**: Mayor Aldwin Thorne
- **Role**: Figurehead, signs documents
- **Real Power**: Merchant Guild controls him through debt

### City Council

Seven seats, each representing:
1. Merchant interests
2. Guild interests
3. Church interests
4. Noble interests
5. Adventurer Guild
6. Craftsmen
7. "Public" (actually another merchant)

Victor's goal: Control 4 seats = control city.
