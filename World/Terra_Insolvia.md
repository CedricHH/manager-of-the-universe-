# Terra-Insolvia - World Bible

> A fantasy world undergoing magical recession

---

## World Overview

**Terra-Insolvia** (nicknamed "Fantasy-404" by the Consortium) is not a mystical realm—it's a cosmic business unit in distress. Where other heroes see adventures, Victor sees arbitrage opportunities.

### Core Premise

- The world runs on **dungeons** (as economic engines)
- Dungeons are **failing start-ups** run by incompetent gods
- The **Galactic Audit Consortium** has sent Victor to restructure
- Magic is **currency-based** (literally burns gold)

---

## Dungeons as Corporations

### Structure

| Dungeon Element | Corporate Equivalent |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Dungeon Core | CEO |
| Boss Monsters | Middle Management |
| Regular Monsters | Workers (underpaid) |
| Adventurers | Hostile auditors |
| Loot | Profit distribution |
| Dungeon Death | Bankruptcy |

### Economic Model

Dungeons must generate "profit" (dead adventurers = soul energy) to pay "rent" (existence tax) to the universe. Most dungeons are **inefficient**:
- Monsters placed randomly, not strategically
- Traps too obvious
- Boss fights predictable

Victor's approach: offer dungeon cores a **consulting partnership**. He optimizes their lethality and takes a commission.

## Major Factions

### 1. The Galactic Audit Consortium (The Auditors)

**Role**: Background antagonists / Victor's employers

Victor works FOR them... but plans to take them over from within.

### 4. The Demon Lords (Hostile Competitors)
