# ARMI System - Magic & Mechanics

> **Apex Resource Management Interface**
> The unique System granted to Victor Kaine by the Galactic Audit Consortium

---

## Core Concept: Gold = Mana

Unlike traditional mana pools, Victor's power source is **currency**.

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No Mana Pool** | Victor's base mana is always 0 |
| **Gold Conversion** | Physical gold or digital credit = magical energy |
| **Base Rate** | 1 Gold Piece (GP) = 10 Mana Points (MP) |
| **Volatility** | Crisis = inflation = skills cost more |

### The Golden Parachute (Passive)

Victor's HP is linked to his bank account:
- Lethal damage → Gold auto-deducted → Body regenerates
- Rate: **1 HP = 100 GP**
- He is immortal **as long as he is rich**
- If broke, he dies from a single scratch

---

## System Interface (UI/UX)

### Visual Design

Unlike typical blue fantasy screens, ARMI resembles:
- **Bloomberg Terminal** aesthetic
- **Colors**: Black, Gold, Alert Red
- **Ticker**: Real-time data scrolling at vision edge (Gold rate, inflation, guild stocks)

### Audio Cues

| Event | Sound |
|-------|-------|
| New Quest | Dot-matrix printer rattling |
| Kill/Loot | Cash register "cha-ching" |
| Low HP/GP | Margin call siren |
| Level Up | Stock market opening bell |

### Too Big to Fail

- The universe manipulates probability to keep him alive
- His death would cause global economic collapse

### Micro-Management (Passive Aspect)

## Economic Mechanics

### Gold Volatility

| Situation | Effect on Skill Costs |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Peacetime | Base rate (1 GP = 10 MP) |
| War/Crisis | Inflation (+50-200% cost) |
| Depression | Deflation (-20% cost, but no one has money) |

### The Inner Conflict

Victor faces a constant dilemma:
> "Is it worth spending 5,000 GP on [Market Crash] to kill this boss if the loot is only worth 3,000 GP?"

This greed-vs-survival tension is a core comedic element.
