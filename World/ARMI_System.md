# ARMI System - Magic & Mechanics

> **Apex Resource Management Interface**
> The unique System granted to Victor Kaine by the Galactic Audit Consortium

---

## Core Concept: Gold = Mana

Unlike traditional mana pools, Victor's power source is **currency**.

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No Mana Pool** | Victor's base mana is always 0 |
| **Gold Conversion** | Physical gold or digital credit = magical energy |
| **Base Rate** | 1 Gold Piece (GP) = 10 Mana Points (MP) |
| **Volatility** | Crisis = inflation = skills cost more |

### The Golden Parachute (Passive)

Victor's HP is linked to his bank account:

- Lethal damage → Gold auto-deducted → Body regenerates
- Rate: **1 HP = 100 GP**
- He is immortal **as long as he is rich**
- If broke, he dies from a single scratch

---

## Dual Level System

Victor's progression operates on **TWO parallel tracks**:

### Track 1: Universal Level (EXP-Based)

Like all beings in Terra Insolvia, Victor gains EXP from combat kills.

| Source | EXP Formula |
|--------|-------------|
| Kill (lower level) | Enemy Level × 10 |
| Kill (equal level) | Enemy Level × 50 |
| Kill (higher level) | Enemy Level × 100 + (Level Diff × 50) |
| Quest Completion | Variable |

**Stat Points**: +5 per Level Up

> **Victor's Default Allocation (INT-focused)**:
>
> - INT: +2 (Strategic Planning)
> - CHA: +2 (Negotiation)
> - WIS: +1 (Risk Assessment)
> - STR/AGI/VIT: 0 (Combat irrelevant)

#### EXP Thresholds

| Level | Required EXP | Cumulative |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1 → 2 | 500 | 500 |
| 2 → 3 | 750 | 1,250 |
| 3 → 4 | 1,000 | 2,250 |
| 4 → 5 | 1,500 | 3,750 |
| 5 → 6 | 2,000 | 5,750 |
| 6 → 7 | 3,000 | 8,750 |
| 7 → 8 | 4,000 | 12,750 |
| 8 → 9 | 5,000 | 17,750 |
| 9 → 10 | 7,500 | 25,250 |
| 10+ | +50% per level | - |

#### Party EXP Distribution

| Role | EXP Share |
|------|-----------|
| **Solo Kill** | 100% |
| **Kill Command** (directed minions) | 50% |
| **Coordination** (tactical support) | 25% |
| **Observation** (no participation) | 5% |

### Track 2: Job Level (Asset Manager)

Victor's **class abilities** scale with economic success, not EXP.

| Metric | Job Level |
|--------|-----------|
| Net Worth 0-999 GP | Job Lv. 1 |
| Net Worth 1,000-9,999 GP | Job Lv. 2 |
| Net Worth 10,000-99,999 GP | Job Lv. 3 |
| Net Worth 100,000-999,999 GP | Job Lv. 4 |
| Net Worth 1,000,000+ GP | Job Lv. 5 |
| Highest Asset Value | +1 per 100k GP |

**Job Level Effects**:

- Skill unlock thresholds
- Contract binding authority
- ARMI interface features
- Consortium clearance access

## System Interface (UI/UX)

### Visual Design

Unlike typical blue fantasy screens, ARMI resembles:

- **Bloomberg Terminal** aesthetic
- **Colors**: Black, Gold, Alert Red
- **Ticker**: Real-time data scrolling at vision edge (Gold rate, inflation, guild stocks)

### Audio Cues

| Event | Sound |
|-------|-------|
| New Quest | Dot-matrix printer rattling |
| Kill/Loot | Cash register "cha-ching" |
| Low HP/GP | Margin call siren |
| Level Up | Stock market opening bell |

- The universe manipulates probability to keep him alive
- His death would cause global economic collapse

- Can redistribute their skill points against their will

## Economic Mechanics

### Gold Volatility

| Depression | Deflation (-20% cost, but no one has money) |

### The Inner Conflict

Victor faces a constant dilemma:
> "Is it worth spending 5,000 GP on [Market Crash] to kill this boss if the loot is only worth 3,000 GP?"

This greed-vs-survival tension is a core comedic element.
