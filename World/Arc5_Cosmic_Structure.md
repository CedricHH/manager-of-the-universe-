## The Galactic Audit Consortium

### What is the Consortium?

The universe is a **managed system**.

| Aspect | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Origin | Created at Big Bang |
| Purpose | Optimize existence |
| Method | Assign agents to manage worlds |
| Problem | 14 billion years of bureaucracy |

### Consortium Hierarchy

```
THE BOARD (Unknown entities above even Auditors)
    ↓
AUDITOR PRIMES (Zethrix's level)
    ↓
SENIOR AUDITORS (System administrators)
    ↓
AUDITORS (World managers)
    ↓
RESTRUCTURERS (Crisis agents like Victor)
    ↓
INTERNS (Echo)
```

### The Inefficiency Problem

The Consortium SHOULD optimize reality. Instead:
- Backlog: 4 billion years of unprocessed cases
- Failed worlds: 67% of projects abandoned
- Resource waste: Prayers stockpiled, never answered
- Corruption: Auditors protect their positions, not efficiency

**Victor's insight**: The Consortium is the problem it claims to solve.

## Divine Economics

### How Gods Work

| Concept | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Power Source | Worship (prayers = energy) |
| Maintenance | Minimum worshipper count or fade |
| Competition | Gods fight for followers |
| Oversight | Consortium regulates divine markets |

### The Prayer Economy

```
MORTAL PRAYERS
    ↓ (collected by gods)
DIVINE POWER
    ↓ (taxed by Consortium)
COSMIC RESERVES
    ↓ (hoarded, never used)
```

**Problem**: Prayers go IN, nothing comes OUT. The system drains without returning.

### Victor's Disruption

The Prosperity Doctrine bypasses gods:
- Pray for SUCCESS, not miracles
- Aurum (Commerce Goddess) channels these prayers
- Direct return: Work → Reward (no divine middleman)

This threatens the entire divine economy.

## Cosmic Geography

### The Layers of Reality

| Layer | Description | Denizens |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Material Plane** | Physical worlds | Mortals |
| **Spirit Realm** | Soul processing | Reapers, ghosts |
| **Divine Courts** | God headquarters | Gods, angels |
| **Auditor Space** | Consortium operations | Auditors |
| **The Void** | Entropy's domain | Void Mother |
| **The Archive** | Stored entities | Restructurer #1 |

### Travel Between Layers

- Mortals: Cannot (normally)
- Gods: At will within their domain
- Auditors: All access
- Victor: ARMI provides limited access

---

## Restructurer #1: The Archive

### What is the Archive?

A cosmic prison for "successful" agents:

| Prisoner | Offense | Sentence |
|----------|---------|----------|
| #1 | "Excessive success" | Eternal storage |
| #7 | "Questioned protocols" | 890 million years |
| #156 | "Formed attachments" | 2 billion years |
| #402 | Destroyed by Victor | N/A (dead) |

### Victor's Risk

If he succeeds too much, he'll be archived too.

The difference: Victor knows this. And plans for it.

---

## The Void Mother

### Entropy's Nature

The Void Mother isn't evil. She's INEVITABLE.

| Aspect | Truth |
|--------|-------|
| Goal | None (entropy doesn't plan) |
| Method | Waiting |
| Threat | Everything ends eventually |
| Weakness | None (?) |

### The Negotiation

No one has ever offered entropy a DEAL.

What could entropy want?
- Faster decay? (No, she's patient)
- Companionship? (Interesting...)
- Recognition? (Never acknowledged before)

Victor's approach: Treat entropy as a **business partner, not an enemy**.

---

## Terra-Insolvia: The Awakened World

### Planetary Consciousness

Victor's economic activity woke the planet:

| Before Victor | After Victor |
|---------------|--------------|
| Sleeping | Conscious |
| No identity | Developing personality |
| Scheduled for liquidation | "Profitable asset" |

### The Alliance

Terra offers:
- Planetary mana access
- Direct environmental control
- Geological awareness

In exchange:
- Protection from Consortium liquidation
- Continued "development" (economic activity)
- Recognition as partner, not resource

---

## The Board

### The Ultimate Authority

Above even Auditor Primes exist THE BOARD.

No one has seen them. No one knows what they are.

They created the Consortium. They set the rules.

**Victor's ultimate target**: Replace the Board? Join it? Restructure it?

---

## Cosmic Economics

### Universal Currency: Potential

Beyond gold, beyond souls, the universe runs on POTENTIAL:
- Unrealized possibilities
- Unused capabilities
- Untapped resources

The Consortium hoards potential. Victor wants to SPEND it.

### The Argument

| Consortium Says | Victor Says |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "Preserve potential for stability" | "Unused potential is waste" |
| "Avoid risk" | "Risk is investment" |
| "Maintain status quo" | "Status quo decays" |

---

## Arc 5 Conflict Points

1. **Consortium Opposition**: Zethrix moves to terminate Victor
2. **Divine Rebellion**: Gods choose sides
3. **#1's Game**: Is the first Restructurer ally or user?
4. **Echo's Choice**: Intern must pick a side
5. **Void Mother**: Can entropy be negotiated with?
6. **Terra's Awakening**: World spirit's development
7. **The Board**: Final mystery

---

## Possible Endings

| Ending | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **Termination** | Victor archived like #1 |
| **Replacement** | Victor becomes new Auditor Prime |
| **Revolution** | Consortium restructured entirely |
| **Transcendence** | Victor becomes something new |
| **Negotiation** | New cosmic balance achieved |
